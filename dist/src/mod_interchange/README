mod_interchange
===============

Version: 1.04

Description
-----------
mod_interchange is designed to replace the vlink and tlink programs that
come with Interchange. The Interchange link protocol is implemented via
an Apache module which saves us the (small) overhead of the execution
of a CGI program.

Requires
--------
Apache 1.3.6 or later
Any version of Interchange (all the way back to MiniVend 3.12)

Installing
----------
The included Makefile builds the module as a DSO object. So if your
Apache has mod_dso.so configured you can do:

make 
make install

If not, you can copy the file mod_interchange.c to src/modules/extra
and add the option:

--activate-module=src/modules/extra/mod_interchange.c

to the 'configure' command when building Apache.

Configuring Interchange
-----------------------
First you need to decide what URL path you want to point to Interchange,
and make sure you don't need any files from that same path. For example,
with the default Construct Something demo you have HTML and images in:

http://www.yourdomain.com/construct/*

So you can't have mod_interchange take over the /construct path. Instead
use a different name like /store, so that users will access the site with
a URL like:

http://www.yourdomain.com/store

And Apache will still be able to serve images from /construct/* just fine.

To make such a change, you need to modify the Catalog directive in
interchange.cfg to look like this:

Catalog  construct  /var/lib/interchange/construct  /store

And update the CGI_URL variable in catalog.cfg by uncommenting and changing
this line:

Variable  CGI_URL  /store

Configuring Apache
------------------
The module understands one directive which specifies the way to contact
the Interchange server. The directive InterchangeServer takes either a
full pathname to the Interchange UNIX socket or a host:port specification
if you want to use INET mode.

That means you need to add new Location section to your Apache httpd.conf.
We'll discuss the two kinds of InterchangeServer settings separately.

UNIX socket setup
-----------------
Here is an example httpd.conf section for connecting to Interchange via
a UNIX socket on the same machine Apache's running on:

<Location /store>
	SetHandler interchange-handler
	InterchangeServer /var/run/interchange/socket
</Location>

Since you're not using the set-UID CGI executable anymore, you need to
allow the Apache daemon to read from and write to the socket directly.
This is slightly tricky because Interchange recreates the socket file each
time it is run, so you can't just modify the ownership and permissions
of the socket file directly.

We solve this by setting the group ownership of the directory the socket
is in to a group Apache is a member of (usually www, apache, http, nobody,
or similar):

chgrp apache /var/run/interchange

Then we make the directory set-GID so any files created in it will have
the same group ownership as the directory:

chmod g+srx /var/run/interchange

Obviously you'll need to substitute the correct group for 'apache' and the
right parent directory of the socket where we show '/var/run/interchange'.
In a non-RPM Interchange installation the directory is 'etc' inside the
Interchange software directory (perhaps /usr/local/interchange).

Next you need to add this directive to interchange.cfg:

SocketPerms 0660

This tells Interchange to allow reading from and writing to the socket by
the group (which our set-GID directory will set to the group the Apache
daemon is in), instead of the default 0600, which would only allow reading
and writing by the owner (the Interchange user, usually 'interch').

INET socket setup
-----------------
This is the configuration to connect to Interchange via INET sockets:

<Location /store>
	SetHandler interchange-handler
	InterchangeServer ic.host.com:7786
</Location>

The port number is optional if you're using the default port 7786.

History
-------
mod_interchange is the direct descendant of mod_minivend, created by
Francis J. Lacoste <francis.lacoste@iNsu.com> at iNsu Innovations Inc.
in 1999. Thanks, Francis!

Maintenance of the module was taken over by Red Hat (formerly Akopia)
in February 2001, with Francis's blessing. The only changes we've made
so far are to rename occurrences of MiniVend to Interchange, expand the
documentation, and include it in the standard Interchange distribution
starting with Interchange 4.6.4.
