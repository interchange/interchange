Something has gone wrong, and we did not receive the response we
expected from your browser.  There was the following problem:

<UL>
<LI>
	If you bookmarked a shopping cart after it had been recalculated
	(or if the item was ordered from a form submission), then the system may
	not have been able to determine where it should go.  If that is
	the case, [page __ORDER_STYLE__/basket]check your shopping basket</A>.
	<P>
<LI>
	Some Internet Service Providers who use proxy servers 
	send you to a secure page from a different net location
	(AOL is an example).
	If your browser does not accept
	<A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html">cookies</A>,
	then this software may not be able to determine your session
	number -- it qualifies your session with your location for
	security.
	<P>
	If you go back to a previous page and RELOAD with cookies enabled,
	then this condition should be corrected. You can verify that we
	send a proper cookie if you turn on the cookie warning feature of your
	browser. Typically, we will save cookies only if you check a box
	that asks us to save your information.
	<P>
	You can also try looking at the checkout page non-securely,
	though we don't recommend you send sensitive information like
	a credit card number without encryption.
