<p>The Catalog Wizard gets you started with the Interchange e-commerce
platform. It will lead you through the process of configuring the
fundamentals of your store. When you finish you will have a fully
functioning e-commerce site!</p>

<p>The checklist at the left side of the page shows your progress in
the Catalog Wizard. You can complete the sections in any order and you
can go back to any section at any time. At any point in the Catalog
Wizard process you can choose to stop, save your settings, and continue
later.<p>

<p>The top navigation bar is a standard part of the Administration Tool of
Interchange. The Administration Tool allows you to create, maintain,
and revise information about your company, customers, orders, products,
or design of the site.</p>
