TAXAREA
.
For the US, this is usually the state(s) your business is
located in. Non-US users will probably have to set this
differently depending on their tax laws.

TAXRATE
.
For US users, this looks like STATE=RATE, where the rate
is in percent. The default below taxes Ohio at 6% and 
Illinois at 7.25 percent. More states can be added or
you can have only one. Should correspond to TAXAREA.

SOMESQL
.
Interchange has a workable internal database, but many things will
work better (and a few worse) if you use a SQL database. Interchange
can configure MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle in a test configuration.

MYSQL
.
You can select this to use MySQL in your test catalog. Careful!
This requires the ability to create a database named "test_foundation",
and is highly dependent on your Perl and MySQL configuration. Don't
be too surprised if this doesn't work.

DB2
.
You can select this to use DB2 in your test catalog. Careful!
This requires the ability to create a database named "intchg",
and is highly dependent on your Perl and DB2 configuration. Don't
be too surprised if this doesn't work.

MYSQLCREATE
.
We can try and use mysqladmin to create the database in
MySQL. In many default MySQL distributions, any user can create
a database beginning with "test". 
.
Use the next option to add parameters. If your MySQL is password-protected
(and you know the password) you may want to add "-u root -p".

MYSQLTRANSACT
.
We can use the InnoDB table type in MySQL 3.23 and higher to
allow transactions for orders. This prevents insertion of
and updates to the order entry logs when there is an error.
.
If you have MySQL 4.0 you should certainly use this -- if you
are using MySQL 3.23 or higher you might want to use it if the
InnoDB table type is configured in.

MYSQLCREATEOPT
.
To create the database you may need to supply a password and
username. To do that, add the option "-u USERNAME -p", where
USERNAME is a MySQL user with permission to create databases.
This is often the user "root".

PGSQL
.
You can select this to use PostgreSQL in your test catalog.
This requires the ability to create a database named "test_foundation",
and is highly dependent on your Perl and system configuration. Don't
be too surprised if this doesn't work.

ORACLE
.
You can select this to use Oracle in your test catalog. This requires
that you know your Oracle DSN and that you've already created a user and
tablespace for Interchange. You should also have the environment variables
ORACLE_BASE, ORACLE_HOME, and ORACLE_SID set. Don't be too surprised if
this doesn't work.

SAMPDATATYPE
.
You can choose to pre-populate your Foundation template with some
data which might be illustrative. You can always delete it later
and replace it with your own.
.
The types are:
.
    tools      Construct Something, includes products, users, orders
    reports    Marketing reports, downloadable softgoods, products, users
    none       No data. Same as leaving blank.

MULTIORDER
.
Interchange can do order pages in any way; two examples are provided.
The default is single-page.

TEMPLATE
.
There are three color schemes available as an example of
how you might template catalogs. Select one of:
.
  brown1  blue1  yellow1

UPSADDER
.
For the UPS lookup, the standard UPS tables are normally
used. If you want to add a handling charge, do it here.

SUPERUSER
.
You can use Interchange's companion configuration
interface, to do upload/download of files, manipulation of
the database, reconfiguration of the catalog, and much more.
.
To enable the UI, you will need a "super-user" account
name that has full access.
.
The initial password is "pass". CHANGE IT! You can do this
by going to the admin menu and selecting the superuser and
then "Change password".

STYLE
.
You can select one of several color schemes:
.
    blueyellow (default) Blues and Yellows
    fixedwidth           Fixed width display
    foundation           Foundation Red
    grayorange           Gray and Orange
    grayscale            Grays
    greens               Green
    purpleyellow         Purple and Yellow
.
You get the idea. Choose one.
