 It allows customers to select items to buy from catalog pages. The program
 tracks user information in sessions and interacts with a HTTP server
 through sockets.

Description: Integration of the Interchange link protocol with Apache
 mod_interchange is designed to replace the vlink and tlink programs that
 come with Interchange. The Interchange link protocol is implemented via
 an Apache module which saves us the (small) overhead of the execution
 of a CGI program.
