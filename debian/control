Description: Standard store, a sample Interchange catalog
 The Standard store is a demo catalog which you can use to
 build your Interchange applications from. While the Standard store
 is designed to be relatively easy to start with, it is still a full-featured

 Once you understand the Standard store and how it works you are well
