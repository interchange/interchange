You can install Interchange as root for a multi-user system-wide setup, or
as an unprivileged user who will be the only one modifying Interchange files.

Here is the quick installation summary:

gzip -dc interchange-5.3.0.tar.gz | tar xvf -
cd interchange-5.3.0
./configure

The configure script asks where you'd like to install Interchange, and
(against common practice) also install it.

The Interchange server doesn't do much if it isn't servicing one or more
actual catalogs, so you next need to make your first Interchange catalog,
as described in the next section.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 D E M O

There is a demo catalog skeleton included called 'standard'.

To build your own catalog from the demo, go to the directory where you
installed Interchange (default is "interchange" in your home directory,
/usr/local/interchange for root installations, or /usr/lib/interchange
for RPM installations) and run:

bin/makecat

Follow the prompts and after restarting the Interchange server you
should be able to access the demo catalog.

Please note that some functionality (notably the reporting features)
may not be available if you are not using an SQL database such as
MySQL or PostgreSQL.

Visit http://demo.icdevgroup.org/ to try out a live demo.

formats. This and other information is available at the Interchange home on
the web:

Interchange is regularly tested on various Linux distributions and FreeBSD.
It has also been used on Mac OS X, Solaris, OpenBSD, Digital UNIX/Tru64, SCO,
AIX, and other Unix variants. It should work on any Unix with Perl 5.6.0 or
higher and the necessary Perl modules.
