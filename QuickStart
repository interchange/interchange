Welcome to Interchange!

--------------------------------------------------------------

                        QUICK START

Intro
    This document is a subset of the complete Interchange
    documentation.  Most of the information contained here is
    is duplicated in the general Interchange documentation. This
    document is designed to give you a starting point.  Interchange
    is fairly complex and can take a lot of time and effort to
    master.  Don't Panic.

What happened to Minivend and Tallyman?
    First there was Minivend, the open source ecommerce system begun by
    Mike Heins about five years ago.  Thousands of sites are using it,
    and it has evolved into a powerful and versatile tool over the years.
    Separately, Akopia was started by an experienced ecommerce development
    team with the goal of making a sophisticated open source ecommerce
    system that's intuitive and easy to use.  Minivend was very feature
    rich, but difficult to learn and use.  Tallyman was intuitive, and had
    great content management features, but lacked some of Minivend's
    capabilities.  So we joined forces, and Interchange is the result.
    Interchange 4.5 replaces both Tallyman and Minivend.  Minivend users
    will find the upgrade to Interchange relatively painless.  Tallyman
    users will not be as lucky.  Keep an eye on the web site for more
    details.  Until we iron out all of the naming issues the term "minivend"
    will be all over the code.  Then name "Tallyman" will be all over
    the UI, and the name Interchange will be all over the documentation.

Requirements:
        Perl5.005 or higher
            Interchange is written (almost) entirely in perl.  No
            extra modules are required to work, but some may be necessary
            to extend Interchange's functionality.

        Web Server
            Any web server with which you are familiar and has cgi
            capabilities should work. Apache is most commonly used.
            The install scripts assume apache is installed and running.

Install Walkthrough
        Make sure that you have user permissions to do the following:
             Write on the catalog install directory
             Read on the Apache config file (if possible)
             Write on the cgi-bin for the web server

        Unpack the distribution:
            gzip -dc interchange-4.5.x.tar.gz | tar xvf -

        Run the configuration script:
            ./configure
                You will be asked to enter the path for the install
                directory for the Interchange distribution.
				If you have the Storable module installed, you may be asked
				how you would like to use it.  Choose the defualt.

Demo Store Install Walkthrough

     We'll be walking the whole install and setup process.  The text
     that you'll see during the install will be displayed with <-- next
     to it.  What's marked with --> is what you'll need to enter in.

     In order to begin, you will need permissions on your server for
     the following:
        Write on the catalog install directory
        Write on the Interchange install directory
        Write on the cgi-bin directory
        Write on the httpd document root

     If you don't know what any of this means, you might as well
     stop now.  Akopia can set you up with a server with Interchange
     pre-installed and you won't have to know anything about server
     permissions or root access.  See the web site for more details.

     To begin:

     Change to the directory in which Interchange is installed:
            cd /home/user/interchange
     Run the makecat script
            bin/makecat

     You will be asked a series of questions at this point.  If you
     want to change the answers to any of these questions later, it
     can be done through the editing of the configuration scripts.
	 The installer does its best to pick defaults that will work best
	 with your configuration.  Most of the time the default responses
	 will work just fine.

<--Select a short, mnemonic name for the catalog. This will be
<--used to set the defaults for naming the catalog, executable,
<--and directory, so you will have to type in this name frequently.

<--NOTE: This will be the name of 'vlink' or 'tlink', the link CGI
<--program. Depending on your CGI setup, it may also have the
<--extension .cgi added.

<--If you are doing the demo for the first time, you might use "construct".

    This will be the name of your catalog.  The installer will use this
    name as the unique identifier for this catalog.  This will be the
    name of the cgi script that intercepts interchange requests.  It
    will also be used as the default for the directory in which to
    store catalog files.

<--Catalog name?
-->construct

    I chose "construct" as the catalog name in this case.

<--makecat -- Interchange catalog installation program.

<--*** We will be making a catalog named 'construct'. ***


<--New configuration file '/home/sonny/akopia/tmp/interchange/etc/makecat.cfg'

<--If you are using the Apache or NCSA web server, Interchange can set
<--some of the default parameters for you by reading the file.

<--If you use the Netscape Enterprise server or other non-NCSA HTTP server,
<--enter 'none' -- the information, if any, will not be useful.


<--Try using the UP arrow at some of the prompts -- you have the
<--Term::ReadLine module installed, and Interchange may find some
<--default values in your HTTP server configuration file.  You can
<--cycle among them with the UP and DOWN arrows.

<--Enter path to httpd.conf file: /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf
-->/usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf

<--This demo configuration sometimes requires root permissions,
<--depending on your ISP.  It needs to copy a few files to the CGI
<--and HTML directories.

<--You must either have your own CGI directory, or be able to run
<--a CGI with an extension like '.cgi'.

<--If you will be operating only on directories owned by the
<--user you are running this as, you will be able to do
<--everything.


<--Since there was no master configuration file, we will ask
<--some questions to help set initial defaults for making this
<--and future catalogs.

<--Interchange can set many of the defaults for you if it knows the server
<--name that is going to be used.

<--Enter the default server that should be used. This is only a default, to
<--determine the *first* one that will be looked at -- you will be given
<--a choice of all available servers.

<--There is a "history" mechanism that will allow you to use the up
<--and down arrows on your terminal (assuming you have a standard terminal)
<--to cycle between possible choices.  This should contain the available
<--servers.

<--Default server? localhost
-->localhost

    It is the name at which the web server is receiving connections.
    Interchange will also be running on this server.


<--We need to know if all of your CGI programs are run as a file ending
<--in .cgi or some other extension, or whether you have your own personal
<--CGI directory.

<--Do you have a CGI directory? y
-->y

<--# The location of the normal CGI directory. This is a
<--# file path, not a script alias.
<--#
<--# If all of your CGI programs must end in .cgi, this is
<--# should be the same as your HTML directory.
<--#

<--CgiDir? [/usr/local/httpd/cgi-bin]
-->/usr/local/httpd/cgi-bin

<--#
<--# The URL-style location of the normal CGI directory.
<--# Only used to set the default for the CgiUrl setting.
<--# 
<--# DO NOT PUT A TRAILING /.
<--#
<--# http://www.virtual.com/cgi-bin/prog
<--#                       ^^^^^^^^
<--#
<--# If you have no CGI-bin directory, (your CGI programs end
<--# in .cgi), leave this blank.
<--#


<--CgiBase? /cgi-bin
-->/cgi-bin

    This is the URL to the cgi program for your catalog (example in
    this case).  This would be the script-alias in the httpd.conf set
    up for your cgi-bin.


<--# The base directory for HTML for this (possibly virtual) domain.
<--# This is a directory path name, not a URL -- it is your HTML
<--# directory.
<--#

<--DocumentRoot? /home/ic_user/public_html
-->/home/ic_user/public_html

	This is the directory path to your html document root.  A number of
  	static elements of your catalog will be stored here.


<--# This is a directory path name (not a URL) where the administration user
<--# interface images from share/ should be copied to. These will normally be
<--# shared by all catalogs. Often this is the same as your DocumentRoot.
<--#

<--ShareDir? /home/ic_user/public_html
-->/home/ic_user/public_html

	If you wish to use the same admin interface for all of your catalogs, the
	common files can be shared in this directory.

<--# The URL base for the administration user interface images. Sets the
<--# Variable UI_IMG directive in the UI configuration file, ui.cfg.
<--# This is a URL fragment, not an entire URL. If you set ShareDir to be
<--# the same as DocumentRoot, this would just be a '/'.
<--#
<--#         <IMG SRC="/akopia/ui/bg.gif">
<--#                   ^
<--#

<--ShareUrl? /akopia/ui/
-->/akopia/ui

<--# The directory where the Interchange software is installed.
<--#


<--VendRoot? /home/ic_user/interchange
-->/home/ic_user/interchange

<--# 
<--# DIRECTORY where the Interchange catalog directories will go. These
<--# are the catalog files, such as the ASCII database source,
<--# Interchange page files, and catalog.cfg file. Catalogs will
<--# be an individual subdirectory of this directory.
<--#

<--BaseDir? /home/ic_user/catalogs
-->/home/ic_user/catalogs

<--# The user name the Interchange server runs under on this machine. This
<--# should not be the same as the user that runs the HTTP server (i.e.
<--# NOT nobody).
<--#


<--InterchangeUser? ic_user
-->ic_user

<--#########     END BASE CONFIGURATION      #########
<--
<--######### BEGINNING CATALOG CONFIGURATION #########

<--During many of the following operations, defaults are placed in
<--a buffer for you.  You may use the up and down arrows to toggle
<--between the defaults.

<--If you made a mistake on a *previous* entry and realize that
<--in a later one, if you enter ONLY an @ sign and press return you
<--should be returned to the previous step.

<--# The server name, something like: www.company.com
<--#                                  www.company.com:8000
<--#                                  www.company.com/~yourname
<--#
<--Server name? [localhost]
-->localhost

<--# The type of demo catalog to use. Standard types
<--# distributed are:
<--#
<--#    simple   -- database-based catalog, not really simple 8-)
<--#    barry    -- Barry's Books version of "simple"
<--#
<--# If you have defined your own custom template catalog,
<--# you can enter it's name.
<--#
<--# If you are new to Interchange and not a sophisticated web designer,
<--# use "barry" to start with.

<--DemoType? [construct]
-->construct

    There are currently two types of demo's.  Simple is a not so
    very simple implementation of "The Art Store".  Construct something
    newest demo.  This is the most feature rich demo, and a good 
	platform for constructing your own store.


<--# The email address where orders for this catalog should go.
<--# To have a secure catalog, either this should be a local user name and
<--# not go over the Internet -- or use the PGP option.
<--#


<--MailOrderTo? ic_user
-->orders@construct.net

    The contruct catalog is designed to email the orders once they are
    made to the person responsible for handling orders.

<--# Where the Interchange files for this catalog will go, pages,
<--# products, config and all.  This should not be in HTML document
<--# space! Usually a 'catalogs' directory below your home directory
<--# works well. Remember, you will want a test catalog and an online
<--# catalog.
<--#


<--CatRoot? [/home/ic_user/catalogs/example]
-->/home/ic_user/catalogs/example

    This is where the catalog config files and working data go.  The
    default location is a good place for this.


<--# The location of the normal CGI directory. This is a
<--# file path, not a script alias.
<--#
<--# If all of your CGI programs must end in .cgi, this is
<--# should be the same as your HTML directory.
<--#

<--CgiDir? /home/ic_user/public_html/cgi-bin

	A file with you store's name will go into the cgi-bin dir.  This
  	program (vlink or tlink) will provide the bridge between the web
 	server and the Interchange server.


<--# The URL location of the CGI program, without the http://
<--# or server name.
<--#
<--# http://www.virtual.com/cgi-bin/prog
<--#                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<--#
<--# http://www.virtual.com/program.cgi
<--#                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^
<--#


<--CgiUrl? /cgi-bin/construct
-->/cgi-bin/construct

    This is the URL to the cgi program for your catalog (construct in
    this case).  This would be the script-alias in the httpd.conf set
    up for your cgi-bin.

<--#
<--# Additional URL locations for the CGI program, as with CgiUrl.
<--# This is used when calling the catalog from more than one place,
<--# perhaps because your secure server is not the same name as the
<--# non-secure one.
<--#
<--# http://www.secure.domain/secure-bin/prog
<--#                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<--#
<--# We set it to the name of the catalog by default to enable the
<--# internal HTTTP server.
<--#


<--Aliases? /construct
-->/construct

   This one is "beyond the scope of this document."  For the purposes
   of getting started, this option can be safely ignored.  For those
   who really want to know what it is for right now, see the
   documentation for minivend.cfg.


<--# The base directory for HTML for this (possibly virtual) domain.
<--# This is a directory path name, not a URL -- it is your HTML
<--# directory.
<--#


<--DocumentRoot? [/usr/local/httpd/htdocs]
-->/usr/local/httpd/htdocs

<--# Where the sample HTML files (not Interchange pages) should be
<--# installed. There is a difference.  Usually a subdirectory of
<--# your HTML directory.
<--#


<--SampleHtml? [/usr/local/httpd/htdocs/construct]
-->/usr/local/httpd/htdocs/construct

  Interchange will create a directory under the html document root in
  order to store the static html pages for the demo catalog.

<--# Where the image files should be copied. A directory path
<--# name, not a URL.
<--#


<--ImageDir? [/home/sonny/public_html/construct/images]
-->/home/sonny/public_html/construct/images

	Additionally, a place for the images.

<--# The URL base for the sample images. Sets the ImageDir
<--# directive in the catalog configuration file. This is a URL
<--# fragment, not a directory or file name.
<--#
<--#         <IMG SRC="/simple/images/icon.gif">
<--#                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<--#


<--ImageUrl? [/construct/images]

   This is the URL for the images stored in the directory created
   above.  Interchange needs this in order to create <IMG SRC> tags
   for the catalogs dynamic pages.


<--Interchange can use either UNIX- or internet-domain sockets.
<--Most ISPs would prefer UNIX mode, and it is more secure.

<--If you already have a program there, or use a common program
<--and the FullURL directive, select NONE. You will then need
<--to copy the program by hand or otherwise ensure its presence.

<--INET or UNIX mode? [UNIX]
-->UNIX

    Again, this is outside fo this document's scope.  UNIX sockets
    will work just fine.

<--Do you use CGIWRAP or SUEXEC? [n]
-->n

    If you don't know the answer, no should be the right answer.


   Does some stuff.

<--Your company name: .....................Construct Something

<--Interchange has a workable internal database, but many things will
<--work better (and a few worse) if you use a SQL database. Interchange
<--can configure MySQL and Postgres in a test configuration.

<--Set to 1 if you want to use MySQL or Postgres: ..
-->0

    For the purposes of this document, we are going to use the
    Interchange internal database.  Consult the documentation for
    information about using your SQL database of choice.

<--You can use Interchange's companion configuration
<--interface, to do upload/download of files, manipulation of
<--the database, reconfiguration of the catalog, and much more.

<--To enable the UI, you will need a "super-user" account
<--name that has full access.

<--The initial password is "pass". CHANGE IT! You can do this
<--by going to the admin menu and selecting the superuser and
<--then "Change password".

<--Account name that will control this catalog: ..ic_user
-->ic_user
<--Administrative password: ...............pass
-->pass


<--Found system commands to run.

	does some more stuff

<--Found additional system commands to run.

<--To enable image upload feature, you need to make a symbolic
<--link of the image base directory into your catalog directory.

<--uct/images /home/sonny/akopia/catalogs/construct1"? ..y
-->y

	Say yes here if you would like to be able to upload images 
	into interchange.

<--Add catalog to interchange.cfg? y

	This will make your catalog avaliable to the interchange server.
	Now your done with the catalog configuration.


    That's it.  The demo store should be installed and ready to go.  Now
    you want to start the Interchange server:

        /home/user/interchange/bin/interchange

    You should see something like this:

Low traffic settings.
Calling UI....
....UI is loaded....
Interchange V4.5.x
Configuring catalog example...done.
Interchange server started in INET and UNIX mode(s) (process id 22200)

    At this point the Interchange server should be running and waiting
    for connections.

Show off demo store
    Some day we will expand this section.

The adminstrative side
    The administrative site has built-in context sensitive help.  If
    you want more detailed informaiton on how a particular section
    works, click on the "help" link in the upper right hand corner of
    the screen.  A help window will pop up and explain what's going on
    in that particular area.

    How to get there
        Go to http://localhost/cgi-bin/construct/admin/logout.html
        changing whatever is necessary for your setup.  If you see an
        akopia interchange login prompt, that's a very good sign it
        worked.  If not, that is a good sign that it didn't work.

    Logging In
        When you installed the store, you set up a "super-user" and
        password for control of the administrative section.  This is
        it, enter the correct information and click login.
