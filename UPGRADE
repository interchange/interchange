Interchange is designed to be compatible between major versions, and
for the most part a catalog designed under Interchange 4.6 should
be compatible with 4.7 and 4.8.

Full information on upgrades is available in the document icupgrade(8)
(in the distribution in pod/icupgrade.pod).

To upgrade from another 4.x version, it is recommended that you:

    1. Make a tar backup of your Interchange software directory, i.e.
       
            tar xzvf ~/ic_backup.tar.gz /usr/lib/interchange 

    2. Install over the top of it by specifying the same installation
       directory during the installation.

    3. If you have this line in interchange.cfg:

        #include usertag/*

       You should change it to:

        include usertag/*.tag

       (The leading # sign is no longer needed).

       If you have created any other UserTag definitions you will need
       to either rename the file to add a .tag extension, or include
       them explicitly like:

          include usertag/my_tag
  
     4. If you use CyberCash, you should replace these lines in catalog.cfg
        
            Variable CYBER_MODE       mauthonly
            Variable CYBER_CONFIGFILE /path/to/your/merchant_conf

        with
        
            Variable MV_PAYMENT_MODE        cybercash
            Variable MV_PAYMENT_CONFIGFILE  /path/to/your/merchant_conf

     5. Restart Interchange.

That should be it. Test the catalog to make sure it works. 

IF YOU UPGRADED FROM 4.6.x

There is one security change that can break constructs that ran under 4.6.x.

    safe_data=1

        If you had a database object which contained ITL tags and
        they now show up as [itl-tag arg=val], then you probably
        need to add the safe-data=1 parameter around your [loop ...]
        or [query ...] construct.

        The reason this change was made was the capability of Interchange
        to directly enter user submissions into a database. If the
        user put in something in [square brackets], knowingly or even
        unknowingly, it could cause anomalous or insecure behavior. 
        (There were no known exploits in the demo, but they could
        easily be constructed.
