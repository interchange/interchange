<title>Button builder</title>
<p> The <b>Button Builder</b> page allows you create HTML links and buttons for 
  ordering items in your store. </p>

<p>
This function allows for quick access to a product and is useful if you have a few products you want to list on a page or if you want to put an order link on a page on another site.
</p>

<p> The Button Builder can generate either a URL for use in an <b>&lt;A HREF...&gt;</b> 
  HTML tag, or a submit button inside of a <b>&lt;FORM&gt;</b> tag. 
<p>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<b>Build</b><br>
After entering the necessary information, click <b>Build</b> to create the button. The Interchange Administration Site builds the button for you and issues the resulting HTML that displays the button. Cut and this information and paste it to the page on which you want to display the button.
