                  What's new in each version of Interchange
                (in development since the version 5.6 branch)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See UPGRADE document for a list of incompatible changes.


Interchange 5.7.2 not yet released.

Core
----

* Enabled catalog usertags within dispatch routines.

* SpecialSub order_missing added (#221).

* Made TAX_CATEGORY_FIELD work as intended, where a colon-separated
  table and field will work as well as a simple field in the same table
  as the item.

* Fixed rare bug that caused requests to / URL with a query string to fail, e.g.:

  http://hostname/?somevar=1

  Interchange in that case looked for a page called "/?somevar=1".

  Thanks to David Christensen <david@endpoint.com> for the fix.

* Add new SessionCookieSecure boolean catalog directive. When enabled, makes
  session cookie set in https usable only in https.

* Add ability to merge user logins with merged_user field. When the
  user logs in, their username is changed to the value of the ID in
  that field. No default, so not operational in standard demo catalog.
  Enabled with:

  		UserDB  default   merged_user  merge_to

  That would look in the database field "merge_to" for a user name
  to change to.

* Added new SourcePriority catalog directive.

* Force re-configure on compile_link --force.

* Fix table editor bug found by Jeff Boes <jeff@endpoint.com> which
  prevented custom widget type from working.

Payment
-------

* Added PaypalExpress payment module from Lyn St George <info@zolotek.net>.

* Removed long-defunct BoA (Bank of America) payment module. Bank of America
  is a reseller for CyberSource so its module applies:
  http://www.bankofamerica.com/small_business/merchant_card_processing/index.cfm?template=internet_e_commerce

* Removed long-defunct CyberCash payment module.

* Added changes from Bill Carr <bill@bottlenose-wine.com> to
  Business::OnlinePayment to allow extra parameters to be passed.

UserTag
-------

* [run-profile] now accepts ref attribute to check an arbitrary hash.

* Added empty attribute for [convert-date] to display a custom string
  instead of the current date when no proper date is passed.

SystemTag
---------

* The error is now not anymore automatically appended to the output of [error]
  when MV_ERROR_STD_LABEL has a value.

Checks
------

* Allow custom error messages for email_only check.

Interchange 5.7.1 released 2008-11-13.


Core
----

* Perl 5.8.5 or newer is now required.

* Fixed regression in Vend::Table::DBI::set_slice for the following usage
  pattern (RT #200):

  $Db{table}->set_slice('', %parms));

* Quell bogus warnings from Encode::Alias (#224). Thanks to Andy
  <ic@tvcables.co.uk> and Rene Hertell <icdevgroup@hertell.com>.

* Added Nunavut to the list of valid Canadian provinces (#231). Thanks to
  Mathew Jones for the report.

* Fix vulnerability where a string passed in the mv_order_item CGI variable is
  displayed verbatim without any input sanitation if there is a valid sku in
  mv_sku. Thanks to Mat from Bibliopolis for discovering and reporting the
  vulnerability.

* Refined error message for missing actions.

* Vend::Interpolate::interpolate_html returns undef on undefined input text.
  This allows to determine whether $Tag->include fails or just produces an
  empty string.

* Fixed deficiency in Levies, where multiple handling modes separated by null
  would not work as in the old subtotal calculation model.

* Correct cookie-clearing function in UserDB.

* Extend MaxQuantityField config directive to support fields prefixed with
  '=' or '?'.

  By default, there's no behavior change and specification of
  'MaxQuantityField f1 f2' sets max quantity to f1 + f2.

  With f1 =f2, max quantity is unconditionally set to f2.

  With f1 ?f2, max quantity is set to f2 only if f2 > 0.

  By Cameron B. Prince <cameron@princeinternet.com>.

* Allow SQL EXPLAIN and SHOW along with SELECT, for queries.
  Thanks to Frederic Steinfels.

* Allow explicit manual table exports even when NoExportExternal is enabled,
  using the force option to &Vend::Data::export_database.

* Fixed database typing problem for HIDE_FIELD. Reported by Sonny Cook.

* Support "secure cookies", which are sent only over SSL connections.
  From a patch by Frederic Steinfels <fst@highdefinition.ch>.

* Allow XML posts by e.g. Google Checkout, which broke in Interchange 5.6.0
  (RT #219). By Andy <ic@tvcables.co.uk>.

* Currently the only order cleanup available, i.e., functions to run after all
  data in the session has been used for order functions, is the bottom of the
  receipt page, if you happen to know that is the place to do it.

  Provide the new OrderCleanup catalog directive which takes a routine name
  and is an authoritative place to perform such actions, in the same vein as
  AutoLoad and AutoEnd. Implementation possibilites include profiles to be
  run at the end or a SpecialSub.

* Fixed problem with new-style shipping configuration reading a mixed-case
  option.

* Corrected logic flaw that applied UTF-8 handling in some cases where it
  shouldn't have. Fixed by David Christensen <david@endpoint.com>.

Search
------

* mv_force_coordinate (fc) added to force coordinated search. Normally,
  when the number of search field does not match the number of search
  strings (specs), coordinated mode is automatically turned off. With
  'fc', number of search specs is adjusted to match the number of search
  fields, either by filling the array with last-set mv_searchspec, or by
  trimming excess values. Useful when you want to search for one string in
  multiple fields in coordinated mode.

* Removed trailing whitespace from text file headers.

* Under rare circumstances the missing search can fall through in a block
  below, which caused an internal server error in the following code line:

	$obj->{matches} = scalar @{$obj->{mv_results}};

  This is now mitigated by an empty mv_results array and results in a search
  error as one would expect.

* Refining searches with properties in Swish search:

    sf=distribution
    se=lenny

    se=postgresql

  This also reverts the workaround for #111.

UserTag
-------

* srcliteral attribute added to [button] tag. Setting srcliteral avoids
  the image existence check for the src attribute.

* [run-profile] removes automatically generated profiles only.

* scratch attribute added to [capture-page] to store the resulting page in a
  scratch variable, supplied by Phil Smith.

* lines attribute added to [nitems] to show the number of lines in the shopping
  cart instead of the sum of the items (#225).

* Made [capture-page] aware of mapped output (#197, #226).

* Added name and id to list of [image] pass-through attributes.

* We are vulnerable to cross-site scripting problems any time there is a
  <input value="[value foo]"> call. You can get around this, of course,
  with <input value="[value name=foo keep=1 filter=encode_entities"]">
  instead. That is a bit of a mess, though, so I added an alias for that
  called "evalue".

  You call it with [evalue address1], which is identical to
  [value keep=1 filter="encode_entities" name=address1].

* Make backup-database tag work even when NoExportExternal is enabled.

* Add [set-cookie secure=1] option for SSL-only cookies.

OrderCheck
----------

* Added ISBN-13 support to isbn order check and relocated it to code/OrderCheck.

Filters
-------

* Fixed regression in html2text filter to re-allow paragraph attributes such as
  <p align="center">.

Widgets
-------

* Prevent cross-site scripting problem in the country-select widget. Found and
  fixed by Josh Lavin of Perusion.

Admin UI
--------

* Prevent whitespace leaking into CREDIT_CARDS_ACCEPTED variable (#209).

* Sort customer orders by order date, descending (was arbitrary).
  (By Rene Hertell, RT #203.)

* Someone removed email_copy field from userdb table, which meant that
  email was not sent to customers by default on status updates. Changed
  to default to yes if email_copy field not present in user table.

* Added tracking_number field to order status if field exists in orderline,
  and handle it in update_order_status tag.

Payment
-------

* If the tmp/wget directory (or more properly "$Vend::Cfg->{ScratchDir}/wget")
  directory did not exist, use_wget mode failed. Changed code to make
  directory if non-existent, and give better error if by some strange chance
  a file existed there.

* Authorize.net fixes by Josh Lavin of Perusion:

  Allow mv_transaction_id to be sent when mv_order_number has not yet been
  created (the case with all newer catalogs, as they use tid.counter).

  Allow Business Checking type of 'CCD' (defaults to WEB if not set or sent).

Standard demo
-------------

* Added SQLite support.
 
* Disabled product comment to prevent spam showing up on default installations.

* Provide reasonable defaults for shipping mode and country at checkout to avoid
  "not enough information" errors.

* Increased default length of orderline.order_number to 24.

* Modified include/checkout forms to use evalue. There are undoubtedly many
  other places it should be put in. But until this is evaluated properly I
  don't want to do it all over the place. You can do so with this one liner,
  at least pretty reliably:

     perl -pi -e 's{value="\[(value\s+[-\w]+\])}{value="[e$1}g'

  I think we have gotten rid of all VALUE= uppercase kind of things,
  but if not we should now.

Packaging
---------

* Numerous Debian packaging and localization updates.

* Modernize RPM packaging:

  Bundled version of HTML::Entities has been removed, so don't look for it.

  Update syntax used for chown and find.

  Install all man pages to section 8, so the man page for Interchange's
  crontab script doesn't conflict with the system crontab program, and since
  Interchange's "binaries" aren't typically in PATH anyway.

  Stop using deprecated RPM PreReq tag.

  Explicitly require Safe::Hole and Set::Crontab, which the RPM dependency
  checker misses.

  Force use of /usr/lib, not /usr/lib64, on x86_64. We're not installing
  binaries (except the cgi-bin which is in /var/www anyway) and many things
  depend on the /usr/lib location.

  Require Perl 5.8.8 or newer for build and installation to be compatible
  with system threaded Perl.

  Use interchange-* helper scripts directly from SPECS/ in source tarball,
  instead of copying. Enables use of rpmbuild -ta directly on tarball.

  Don't check for IniConf.pm anymore as it's part of dist/lib now.

Interchange 5.7.0 never formally released.
