Interchange Tags Reference

=head1 Interchange Tags Reference

ITL stands for Interchange Tag Language. ITL is a superset of MML, or
Minivend Markup Language. Minivend was the predecessor to Interchange.

There are dozens of ITL pre-defined tag functions. If you don't see
just what you need, you can create user-defined tags to just as
powerful as the pre-defined ones.

There are two styles of supplying parameters to a tag -- named and
positional. In addition, you can usually embed Interchange tags within
HTML tags.

In the named style you supply a parameter/value pair just as most HTML
tags use:

    [value name="foo"]

The same thing can be accomplished for the C<[value]> tag with

    [value foo]

The parameter C<name> is the first positional parameter for the
C<[value]> tag. Some people find positional usage simpler for common
tags, and Interchange interprets them somewhat faster. If you wish to
avoid ambiguity you can always use named calling.

In most cases, tags specified in the positional fashion will work the
same as named parameters. The only time you will need to modify them
is when there is some ambiguity as to which parameter is which
(usually due to whitespace), or when you need to use the output of a
tag as the attribute parameter for another tag.

B<TIP:> This will not work:

    [page scan se=[scratch somevar]]

To get the output of the C<[scratch somevar]> interpreted, you must
place it within a named and quoted attribute:

    [page href=scan arg="se=[scratch somevar]"]

Interchange tags can be specified within HTML to make it easier to
interface to some HTML editors. Consider:

    <TABLE MV="if items">
    <TR MV="item-list">
    <TD> [item-code] </TD>
    <TD> [item-description] </TD>
    <TD> [item-price] </TD>
    </TR></TABLE>

The above will loop over any items in the shopping cart, displaying
their part number, description, and price, but only IF there are items
in the cart.

The same thing can be achieved with:

    [if items]
    <TABLE>
    [item-list]
    <TR>
    <TD> [item-code] </TD>
    <TD> [item-description] </TD>
    <TD> [item-price] </TD>
    </TR>
    [/item-list]</TABLE>
    [/if]

What is done with the results of the tag depends on whether it is a
I<container> or I<standalone> tag. A container tag is one which has an
end tag, i.e. C<[tag] stuff [/tag]>. A standalone tag has no end tag,
as in [area href=somepage].  (Note that [page ...] and [order ..] are
B<not> container tags.)

A container tag will have its output re-parsed for more Interchange
tags by default. If you wish to inhibit this behavior, you must
explicitly set the attribute B<reparse> to 0.  Note that you will
almost always wish the default action. The only container ITL tag that
doesn't have reparse set by default is C<[mvasp]>.

With some exceptions ([include] is among them) among them) the output
of a standalone tag will not be re-interpreted for Interchange tag
constructs. All tags accept the INTERPOLATE=1 tag modifier, which
causes the interpretation to take place. It is frequent that you will
B<not> want to interpret the contents of a [set variable] TAGS [/set]
pair, as that might contain tags which should only be upon evaluating
an order profile, search profile, or I<mv_click> operation. If you
wish to perform the evaluation at the time a variable is set, you
would use [set name=variable interpolate=1] TAGS [/set].

=head2 Looping tags and Sub-tags

Certain tags are not standalone; these are the ones that are
interpreted as part of a surrounding looping tag like C<[loop]>,
C<[item-list]>, C<[query]>, or C<[region]>.

    [PREFIX-accessories]
    [PREFIX-alternate]
    [PREFIX-calc]
    [PREFIX-change]
    [PREFIX-change]
    [PREFIX-code]
    [PREFIX-data]
    [PREFIX-description]
    [PREFIX-discount]
    [PREFIX-field]
    [PREFIX-increment]
    [PREFIX-last]
    [PREFIX-match]
    [PREFIX-modifier]
    [PREFIX-next]
    [PREFIX-param]
    [PREFIX-price]
    [PREFIX-quantity]
    [PREFIX-subtotal]
    [if-PREFIX-data]
    [if-PREFIX-field]
    [modifier-name]
    [quantity-name]

PREFIX represents the prefix that is used in that looping tag. They
are only interpreted within their container and only accept positional
parameters. The default prefixes:

    Tag           Prefix     Examples
    -----        --------   ----------
    [loop]        loop       [loop-code], [loop-field price], [loop-increment]
    [item-list]   item       [item-code], [item-field price], [item-increment]
    [search-list] item       [item-code], [item-field price], [item-increment]
    [query]       sql        [sql-code], [sql-field price], [sql-increment]

Sub-tag behavior is consistent among the looping tags.

There are two types of looping lists; ARRAY and HASH.

An array list is the normal output of a C<[query]>, a search, or a
C<[loop]> tag. It returns from 1 to N C<return fields>, defined in the
C<mv_return_fields> or C<rf> variable or implicitly by means of a SQL
field list. The two queries below are essentially identical:

    [query sql="select foo, bar from products"]
    [/query]

    [loop search="
                    ra=yes
                    fi=products
                    rf=foo,bar
    "]

Both will return an array of arrays consisting of the C<foo> column
and the C<bar> column. The Perl data structure would look like:

    [
        ['foo0', 'bar0'],
        ['foo1', 'bar1'],
        ['foo2', 'bar2'],
        ['fooN', 'barN'],
    ]

A hash list is the normal output of the [item-list] tag. It returns
the value of all return fields in an array of hashes. A normal
[item-list] return might look like:

    [
        {
            code     => '99-102',
            quantity => 1,
            size     => 'XL',
            color    => 'blue',
            mv_ib    => 'products',
        },
        {
            code     => '00-341',
            quantity => 2,
            size     => undef,
            color    => undef,
            mv_ib    => 'products',
        },

    ]

You can also return hash lists in queries:

    [query sql="select foo, bar from products" type=hashref]
    [/query]

Now the data structure will look like:

    [
        { foo => 'foo0', bar => 'bar0' },
        { foo => 'foo1', bar => 'bar1' },
        { foo => 'foo2', bar => 'bar2' },
        { foo => 'fooN', bar => 'barN' },
    ]

=over 4

=item [PREFIX-accessories arglist]

The same as the [accessories ...] tag except always supplied the
current item code. If the list is a hash list, i.e. an [item-list],
then the value of the current item hash is passed so that a value
default can be established.

=item [PREFIX-alternate N] DIVISIBLE [else] NOT DIVISIBLE [/else][/PREFIX-alternate]

Set up an alternation sequence. If the item-increment is divisible by
`N', the text will be displayed. If an `[else]NOT DIVISIBLE
TEXT[/else]' is present, then the NOT DIVISIBLE TEXT will be
displayed.

For example:

    [item-alternate 2]EVEN[else]ODD[/else][/item-alternate]
    [item-alternate 3]BY 3[else]NOT by 3[/else][/item-alternate]

=item [PREFIX-calc] 2 + [item-field price] [/PREFIX-calc]

Calls perl via the equivalent of the [calc] [/calc] tag pair. Much
faster to execute.

=item [PREFIX-change][conditoon] ... [/condition] TEXT [/PREFIX-change]

Sets up a breaking sequence that occurs when the contents of
[condition] [/condition] change. The most common one is a category
break to nest or place headers.

The region is only output when a field or other repeating value
between [condition] and [/condition] changes its value. This allows
indented lists similar to database reports to be easily formatted. 
The repeating value must be a tag interpolated in the search process,
such as C<[PREFIX-field field]> or C<[PREFIX-data database field]>. If
you need access to ITL tags, you can use [PREFIX-calc] with a
$Tag->foo() call.

Of course, this will only work as you expect when the search results
are properly sorted.

The value to be tested is contained within a
C<[condition]value[/condition]> tag pair. The C<[PREFIX-change]> tag
also processes an C<[else] [/else]> pair for output when the value
does not change.

Here is a simple example for a search list that has a field
C<category> and C<subcategory> associated with each item:

 <TABLE>
 <TR><TH>Category</TH><TH>Subcategory</TH><TH>Product</TH></TR>
 [search-list]
 <TR>
    <TD>
         [item-change cat]

         [condition][item-field category][/condition]

                 [item-field category]
         [else]
                 &nbsp;
         [/else]
         [/item-change cat]
    </TD>
    <TD>
         [item-change sub]

         [condition][item-field subcategory][/condition]

                 [item-field subcategory]
         [else]
                 &nbsp;
         [/else]
         [/item-change sub]
    </TD>
    <TD> [item-field name] </TD>
 [/search-list]
 </TABLE>

The above should put out a table that only shows the category and
subcategory once, while showing the name for every product. (The
C<&nbsp;> will prevent blanked table cells if you use a border.)

=item [PREFIX-code]

The key or code of the current loop. In an [item-list] this is always
the product code; in a loop list it is the value of the current
argument; in a search it is whatever you have defined as the first
mv_return_field (rf).

=item [PREFIX-data table field]

Calls the column C<field> in database table C<table> for the current
[PREFIX-code]. This may or may not be equivalent to C<[PREFIX-field
field]> depending on whether your search table is defined as one of
the C<ProductFiles>.

=item [PREFIX-description]

The description of the current item, as defined in the C<catalog.cfg>
directive C<DescriptionField>. In the demo, it would be the value of
the field C<description> in the table C<products>.

If the list is a hash list, and the lookup of C<DescriptionField>
fails, then the attribute C<description> will be substituted. This is
useful to supply shopping cart descriptions for on-the-fly items.

=item [PREFIX-discount]

The price of the current item is calculated, and the difference
between that price and the list price (quantity one) price is output.
This may have different behavior than you expect if you set the
[discount] [/discount] tag along with quantity pricing.

=item [PREFIX-field]

Looks up a field value for the current item in one of several places,
in this order:

    1. The first ProductFiles entry.
    2. Additional ProductFiles in the order they occur.
    3. The attribute value for the item in a hash list.
    4. Blank

A common user error is to do this:

    [loop search="
                    fi=foo
                    se=bar
                "]

    [loop-field foo_field]
    [/loop]

In this case, you are searching the table C<foo> for a string of
C<bar>. When it is found, you wish to display the value of
C<foo_field>. Unless C<foo> is in C<ProductFiles> and the code is not
present in a previous product file, you will get a blank or some value
you don't want. What you really want is C<[loop-data foo foo_field]>,
which specifically addresses the table C<foo>.

=item [PREFIX-increment]

The current count on the list, starting from either 1 in a
zero-anchored list like C<[loop]> or C<[item-list]>, or from the match
count in a search list.

If you skip items with [PREFIX-last] or [PREFIX-next], the count is
NOT adjusted.

=item [PREFIX-last] CONDITION [/PREFIX-last]

If CONDITION evaluates true (a non-whitespace value that is not
specifically zero) then this will be the last item displayed.

=item [PREFIX-modifier attribute]

If the item is a hash list (i.e. [item-list]), this will return the
value of the C<attribute>.

=item [PREFIX-next] CONDITION [/PREFIX-next]

If CONDITION evaluates true (a non-whitespace value that is not
specifically zero) then this item is skipped.

=item [PREFIX-param name]

=item [PREFIX-param N]

Returns the array parameter associated with the looping tag row. Each
looping list returns an array of C<return fields>, set in searches
with C<mv_return_field> or C<rf>. The default is only to return the
code of the search result, but by setting those parameters you can
return more than one item.

In a [query ...] ITL tag you can select multiple return fields with
something like:

    [query prefix=prefix sql="select foo, bar from baz where foo=buz"]
        [prefix-code]  [prefix-param foo]  [prefix-param bar]
    [/query]

In this case, [prefix-code] and [prefix-param foo] are synonymns, for
C<foo> is the first returned parameter and becomes the code for this
row. Another synonym is [prefix-param 0]; and [prefix-param 1] is the
same as [prefix-param bar].

=item [PREFIX-price]

The price of the current code, formatted for currency. If
Interchange's pricing routines cannot determine the price (i.e. it is
not a valid product or on-the-fly item) then zero is returned. If the
list is a hash list, the price will be modified by its C<quantity> or
other applicable attributes (like C<size> in the demo).

=item [PREFIX-quantity]

The value of the C<quantity> attribute in a hash list. Most commonly
used to display the quantity of an item in a shopping cart
[item-list].

=item [PREFIX-subtotal]

The [PREFIX-quantity] times the [PREFIX-price]. This does take
discounts into effect.

=item [if-PREFIX-data table field] IF text [else] ELSE text [/else] [/if-PREFIX-data]

Examines the data field, i.e. [PREFIX-data table field], and if it is
non-blank and non-zero then the C<IF text> will be returned. If it is
false, i.e. blank or zero, the C<ELSE text> will be returned to the
page.

This is much more efficient than the otherwise equivalent C<[if
type=data term=table::field::[PREFIX-code]]>.

You cannot place a condition; i.e. [if-PREFIX-data table field eq
'something']. Use C<[if type=data ...]> for that.

Careful, a space is not a false value!

=item [if-PREFIX-field field] IF text [else] ELSE text [/else] [/if-PREFIX-field]

Same as [if-PREFIX-data ...] except uses the same data rules as
C<[PREFIX-field]>.

=item [modifier-name attribute]

Outputs a variable name which will set an appropriate variable name
for setting the attribute in a form (usually a shopping cart). Outputs
for successive items in the list:

    1. attribute0
    2. attribute1
    3. attribute2

etc.

=item [quantity-name]

Outputs for successive items in the list:

    1. quantity0
    2. quantity1
    3. quantity2

etc. C<[modifier-name quantity]> would be the same as
C<[quantity-name]>.

=item DESCRIPTION

The C<[accessories ...]> tag allows you to access Interchange's option
attribute facility in any of several ways.

If passed any of the optional arguments, initiates special processing
of item attributes based on entries in the product database.

Interchange allows item attributes to be set for each ordered item.
This allows a size, color, or other modifier to be attached to a line
item in the shopping cart. Previous attribute values can be
resubmitted by means of a hidden field on a form.

The C<catalog.cfg> file directive I<UseModifier> is used to set the
name of the modifier or modifiers. For example

    UseModifier        size color

will attach both a size and color attribute to each item code that is
ordered.

B<IMPORTANT NOTE:> You may not use the following names for attributes:

    item  group  quantity  code  mv_ib  mv_mi  mv_si

You can also set it in scratch with the mv_UseModifier scratch
variable -- C<[set mv_UseModifier]size color[/set]> has the same
effect as above. This allows multiple options to be set for products.
Whichever one is in effect at order time will be used. Be careful, you
cannot set it more than once on the same page. Setting the
C<mv_separate_items> or global directive I<SeparateItems> places each
ordered item on a separate line, simplifying attribute handling. The
scratch setting for C<mv_separate_items> has the same effect.

The modifier value is accessed in the C<[item-list]> loop with the
C<[item-param attribute]> tag, and form input fields are placed with
the C<[modifier-name attribute]> tag. This is similar to the way that
quantity is handled.

NOTE: You must be sure that no fields in your forms have digits
appended to their names if the variable is the same name as the
attribute name you select, as the C<[modifier-name size]> variables
will be placed in the user session as the form variables size0, size1,
size2, etc.

Interchange will automatically generate the select boxes when the
C<[accessories <code> size]> or C<[item-accessories size]> tags are
called. They have the syntax:

   [item_accessories attribute, type*, column*, table*, name*, outboard*]

   [accessories code=sku
                attribute=modifier
                type="select|radio|display|show|checkbox|text|textarea"*
                column=column_name*
                table=db_table*
                name=varname
                outboard=key
                passed="value=label, value2, value3=label 3" ]

=over 8

=item code

Not needed for item-accessories, this is the product code of the item
to reference.

=item attribute

The item attribute as specified in the UseModifier configuration
directive. Typical are C<size> or C<color>.

=item type

The action to be taken. One of:

  select          Builds a dropdown <SELECT> menu for the attribute.
                  NOTE: This is the default.

  multiple        Builds a multiple dropdown <SELECT> menu for the
                  attribute.  The size is equal to the number of
                  option choices.

  display         Shows the label text for *only the selected option*.

  show            Shows the option choices (no labels) for the option.

  radio           Builds a radio box group for the item, with spaces
                  separating the elements.

  radio nbsp      Builds a radio box group for the item, with &nbsp;
                  separating the elements.

  radio left n    Builds a radio box group for the item, inside a
                  table, with the checkbox on the left side. If "n"
                  is present and is a digit from 2 to 9, it will align
                  the options in that many columns.

  radio right n   Builds a radio box group for the item, inside a
                  table, with the checkbox on the right side. If "n"
                  is present and is a digit from 2 to 9, it will align
                  the options in that many columns.

  check           Builds a checkbox group for the item, with spaces
                  separating the elements.

  check nbsp      Builds a checkbox group for the item, with &nbsp;
                  separating the elements.

  check left n    Builds a checkbox group for the item, inside a
                  table, with the checkbox on the left side. If "n"
                  is present and is a digit from 2 to 9, it will align
                  the options in that many columns.

  check right n   Builds a checkbox group for the item, inside a
                  table, with the checkbox on the right side. If "n"
                  is present and is a digit from 2 to 9, it will align
                  the options in that many columns.

  textarea_XX_YY  A textarea with XX columns and YY rows

  text_XX         A text box with XX size in characters

  combo           Special type, used with nullselect filter,
                  for selecting from a list or inputting a
                  new value

  reverse_combo   Special type, used with last_non_null filter,
                  for selecting from a list or inputting a
                  new value -- differs from combo in order of
                  presentation

  move_combo      Special type, used with null_to_space or
                  null_to_comma filter, for selecting multiple non-ordered
                  values from a list or inputting into a textarea

  links           Produces a series of links based on the option
                  values. The base form value is passed via the
                                  form parameter, just like in an [area ...] or
                                  [page ...] tag, and the value is named with
                                  the passed NAME attribute.

The default is 'select', which builds an HTML select form entry for
the attribute.  Also recognized is 'multiple', which generates a
multiple-selection drop down list, 'show', which shows the list of
possible attributes, and 'display', which shows the label text for the
selected option only.

=item column

The database column name to be used to build the entry (usually a
field in the products database).  Defaults to a field named the same
as the attribute.

=item table

The database table to find B<column> in, defaults to the first
products file where the item code is found.

=item name

Name of the form variable to use if a form is being built. Defaults to
mv_order_B<attribute> -- i.e.  if the attribute is B<size>, the form
variable will be named B<mv_order_size>. If the variable is set in the
user session, the widget will "remember" its previous setting.

=item outboard

If calling the item-accessories tag, and you wish to select from an
outboard database table with a different key from the item code, you
can pass the key to use to find the accessory data.

=item passed

Options for the widget if set explicitly, i.e. overrides a databae
fetch of the attribute input string.

For example, to generate a select box with a blank option (perhaps
forcing a select), the value of C<blue> with a label of B<Blue>, and
the value of C<green> with a label of B<Sea Green>, do:

        [accessories
            type=select
                name=color
                passed="=--select--, blue=Blue, green=Sea Green"
        ]

This will generate:

        <SELECT NAME="color">
        <OPTION VALUE="">--select--
        <OPTION VALUE="blue">Blue
        <OPTION VALUE="green">Sea Green
        </SELECT>

=item href

Base HREF for the link in a C<links> type. Default is the current
page.

=item form

Base value for the form in a C<links> type. Default is
C<mv_action=return>, which will simply set the variable value in the
link.

For example, to generate a series of links that set the variable
"color" to the same as the options described in the C<passed>
attribute (blank, blue, or green), do

        [accessories
            type=links
                name=color
                passed="=--select--, blue=Blue, green=Sea Green"

When called with an attribute, the database is consulted and looks for
a comma-separated list of attribute options. They take the form:

    name=Label Text, name=Label Text*

The label text is optional -- if none is given, the B<name> will be
used.

If an asterisk is the last character of the label text, the item is
the default selection. If no default is specified, the first will be
the default. An example:

    [item_accessories color]

This will search the product database for a field named "color". If an
entry "beige=Almond, gold=Harvest Gold, White*, green=Avocado" is
found, a select box like this will be built:

    <SELECT NAME="mv_order_color">
    <OPTION VALUE="beige">Almond
    <OPTION VALUE="gold">Harvest Gold
    <OPTION SELECTED>White
    <OPTION VALUE="green">Avocado
    </SELECT>

In combination with the C<mv_order_item> and C<mv_order_quantity>
variables this can be used to allow entry of an attribute at time of
order.

If used in an item list, and the user has changed the value, the
generated select box will automatically retain the current value the
user has selected.

The value can then be displayed with C<[item-modifier size]> on the
order report, order receipt, or any other page containing an
C<[item-list]>.

When called with an attribute, the database is consulted and looks for
a comma-separated list of attribute options. They take the form:

    name=Label Text, name=Label Text*

The label text is optional -- if none is given, the B<name> will be
used.

If an asterisk is the last character of the label text, the item is
the default selection. If no default is specified, the first will be
the default. An example:

    [accessories TK112 color]

This will search the product database for a field named "color". If an
entry "beige=Almond, gold=Harvest Gold, White*, green=Avocado" is
found, a select box like this will be built:

    <SELECT NAME="mv_order_color">
    <OPTION VALUE="beige">Almond
    <OPTION VALUE="gold">Harvest Gold
    <OPTION SELECTED>White
    <OPTION VALUE="green">Avocado
    </SELECT>

In combination with the I<mv_order_item> and I<mv_order_quantity>
variables this can be used to allow entry of an attribute at time of
order.

=item EMULATING WITH LOOP

Below is a fragment from a shopping basket display form which shows a
selectable size with "sticky" setting and a price that changes based
upon the modifier setting. Note that this would normally be contained
within the C<[item_list]> C<[/item-list]> pair.

    <SELECT NAME="[modifier-name size]">
    [loop option="[modifier-name size]" list="S, M, L, XL"]
    <OPTION> [loop-code] -- [price code="[item-code]" size="[loop-code]"]
    [/loop]
    </SELECT>

The above is essentially the same as would be output with the
[item-accessories size] tag if the product database field C<size>
contained the value C<S, M, L, XL>, but contains the adjusted price.

Named call example:

    <A HREF="[area href=scan arg="
                                     se=Impressionists
                                     sf=category
                                "
                            ]">Impressionists</A>

Positional call example:

    <A HREF="[area ord/basket]">Check basket</A>

HTML example:

    <A MV="area dir/page" HREF="dir/page.html">

Produces the URL to call a Interchange page, without the surrounding A
HREF notation. This can be used to get control of your HREF items,
perhaps to place an ALT string or a Javascript construct.

It was originally named C<area> because it also can be used in a
client-side image map, and has an alias of C<href>. The two links
below are identical in operation:

   <A HREF="[area href=catalog]" ALT="Main catalog page">Catalog Home</A>
   <A HREF="[href href=catalog]" ALT="Main catalog page">Catalog Home</A>

The optional I<arg> is used just as in the I<page> tag.

The optional C<form> argument allows you to encode a form in the link.

        <A HREF="[area form="
                mv_order_item=99-102
                mv_order_size=L
                mv_order_quantity=1
                mv_separate_items=1
                mv_todo=refresh"
        ]"> Order t-shirt in Large size </A>

The two form values I<mv_session_id> and I<mv_arg> are automatically
added when appropriate. (I<mv_arg> is the C<arg> parameter for the
tag.)

If the parameter C<href> is not supplied, I<process> is used, causing
normal Interchange form processing.

This would generate a form that ordered item number 99-102 on a
separate line (C<mv_separate_items> being set), with size C<L>, in
quantity 2. Since the page is not set, you will go to the default
shopping cart page -- equally you could set C<mv_orderpage=yourpage>
to go to C<yourpage>.

All normal Interchange form caveats apply -- you must have an action,
you must supply a page if you don't want to go to the default, etc.

You can theoretically submit any form with this, though none of the
included values can have newlines or trailing whitespace. If you want
to do something like that you will have to write a UserTag.

                }
                return $out;
        [/perl]

Tags according to the following rules:

=over 8

=item {key}

Inserts the value of the key for the reference. In a database query,
this is the column name.

=item {key|fallback string}

Displays the value of {key} or if it is zero or blank, the fallback
string.

=item {key true string}

Displays C<true string> if the value of {key} is non-blank, non-zero,
or displays nothing if the key is false.

=item {key?} true text {/key?}

Displays C<true text> if the value of {key} is non-blank, non-zero,
and nothing otherwise.

=item {key:} false text {/key:}

Displays C<false text> if the value of {key} is blank or zero, and
nothing otherwise.

=item CALL INFORMATION

Parameters: B<href if>

Positional parameters in same order.

Pass attribute hash as last to subroutine: B<no>

Must pass named parameter interpolate=1 to cause interpolation.

Invalidates cache: B<no>

Called Routine:

ASP/perl tag calls:

    $Tag->bounce(
        {
         href => VALUE,
         if => VALUE,
        }
    )

 OR

    $Tag->bounce($href, $if);

=item DESCRIPTION

The [bounce ...] tag is designed to send an HTTP redirect (302 status
code) to the browser and redirect it to another (possibly
Interchange-parsed) page.

It will stop ITL code execution at that point; further tags will not
be run through the parser. Bear in mind that if you are inside a
looping list, that list will run to completion and the [bounce] tag
will not be seen until the loop is complete.

Example of bouncing to an Interchange parsed page:

        [if !scratch real_user]
        [bounce href="[area violation]"]
        [/if]

Note the URL is produced by the C<[area ...]> ITL tag.

Since the HTTP says the URL needs to be absolute, this one might cause
a browser warning:

        [if value go_home]
        [bounce href="/"]
        [/if]

But running something like one of the Interchange demos you can do:

        [if value go_home]
        [bounce href="__SERVER_NAME__/"]
        [/if]

        [if value go_home]
        [bounce href="/"]
        [/if]

This is a container tag, i.e. [calc] FOO [/calc]. Nesting: NO

Invalidates cache: B<no>

Called Routine:

ASP/perl tag calls:

    $Tag->calc(

syntax: [calc] EXPRESSION [/calc]

Starts a region where the arguments are calculated according to normal
arithmetic symbols. For instance:

    [calc] 2 + 2 [/calc]

will display:

    4

The [calc] tag is really the same as the [perl] tag, except that it
doesn't accept arguments, interpolates surrounded Interchange tags by
default, and is slightly more efficient to parse.

TIP: The [calc] tag will remember variable values inside one page, so
you can do the equivalent of a memory store and memory recall for a
loop.

ASP NOTE: There is never a reason to use this tag in a [perl] or ASP
section.

    )

 OR

    $Tag->checked($name, $value, $ATTRHASH);

=item DESCRIPTION

You can provide a "memory" for drop-down menus, radio buttons, and
checkboxes with the [checked] and [selected] tags.

    <INPUT TYPE=radio NAME=foo
            VALUE=on [checked name=foo value=on default=1]>
    <INPUT TYPE=radio NAME=foo
            VALUE=off [checked name=foo value=off]>

This will output CHECKED if the variable C<var_name> is equal to
C<value>. Not case sensitive unless the optional C<case=1> parameter
is used.

The C<default> parameter, if true (non-zero and non-blank), will cause
the box to be checked if the variable has never been defined.

Note that CHECKBOX items will never submit their value if not checked,
so the box will not be reset. You must do something like:

    <INPUT TYPE=checkbox NAME=foo
            VALUE=1 [checked name=foo value=1 default=1]>
    [value name=foo set=""]

By default, the Values space (i.e. [value foo]) is checked -- if you
want to use the volatile CGI space (i.e. [cgi foo]) use the option
C<cgi=1>.

filter="uc|lc|name|namecase|no_white|etc."* append=1* value="value to
set to"* increment=1*                         ]

Returns the value of the field in a database table, or (DEPRECATED)
from the C<session> namespace. If the optional B<value> is supplied,
the entry will be changed to that value.  If the option increment* is
present, the field will be atomically incremented with the value in
B<value>. Use negative numbers in C<value> to decrement. The C<append>
attribute causes the value to be appended; and finally, the C<filter>
attribute is a set of Interchange filters that are applied to the data
1) after it is read; or 2)before it is placed in the table.

If a DBM-based database is to be modified, it must be flagged writable
on the page calling the write tag. Use [tag flag write]products[/tag]
to mark the C<products> database writable, for example. B<This must be
done before ANY access to that table.>

DEPRECATED BEHAVIOR: (replace with C<session> tag). In addition, the
C<[data ...]> tag can access a number of elements in the Interchange
session database:

    accesses           Accesses within the last 30 seconds
    arg                The argument passed in a [page ...] or [area ...] tag
    browser            The user browser string
    cybercash_error    Error from last CyberCash operation
    cybercash_result   Hash of results from CyberCash (access with usertag)
    host               Interchange's idea of the host (modified by DomainTail)
    last_error         The last error from the error logging
    last_url           The current Interchange path_info
    logged_in          Whether the user is logged in (add-on UserDB feature)
    pageCount          Number of unique URLs generated
    prev_url           The previous path_info
    referer            HTTP_REFERER string
    ship_message       The last error messages from shipping
    source             Source of original entry to Interchange
    time               Time (seconds since Jan 1, 1970) of last access
    user               The REMOTE_USER string
    username           User name logged in as (UserDB feature)

NOTE: Databases will hide session values, so don't name a database
"session". or you won't be able to use the [data ...] tag to read
them. Case is sensitive, so in a pinch you could call the database
"Session", but it would be better not to use that name at all.

Returns the value of the user form variable C<variable> if it is
non-empty. Otherwise returns C<default>, which is the string "default"
if there is no default supplied. Got that? This tag is DEPRECATED

=item DESCRIPTION

Expands into the description of the product identified by code as
found in the products database. This is the value of the database
field that corresponds to the C<catalog.cfg> directive
C<DescriptionField>. If there is more than one products file defined,
they will be searched in order unless constrained by the optional
argument B<base>.

This tag is especially useful for multi-language catalogs. The
C<DescriptionField> directive can be set for each locale and point to
a different database field; for example C<desc_en> for English,
C<desc_fr> for French, etc.

=item CALL INFORMATION

Parameters: B<code>

Positional parameters in same order.

Pass attribute hash as last to subroutine: B<no>

Must pass named parameter interpolate=1 to cause interpolation.

This is a container tag, i.e. [discount] FOO [/discount]. Nesting: NO

Invalidates cache: B<YES>

Called Routine:

ASP/perl tag calls:

    $Tag->discount(
        {
         code => VALUE,
        },
        BODY
    )

 OR

    $Tag->discount($code, $BODY);

=item DESCRIPTION

Product discounts can be set upon display of any page. The discounts
apply only to the customer receiving them, and are of one of three
types:

    1. A discount for one particular item code (code/key is the item-code)
    2. A discount applying to all item codes (code/key is ALL_ITEMS)
    3. A discount applied after all items are totaled
       (code/key is ENTIRE_ORDER)

The discounts are specified via a formula. The formula is scanned for
the variables $q and $s, which are substituted for with the item
I<quantity> and I<subtotal> respectively. In the case of the item and
all items discount, the formula must evaluate to a new subtotal for
all items I<of that code> that are ordered. The discount for the
entire order is applied to the entire order, and would normally be a
monetary amount to subtract or a flat percentage discount.

Discounts are applied to the effective price of the product, including
any quantity discounts.

To apply a straight 20% discount to all items:

    [discount ALL_ITEMS] $s * .8 [/discount]

or with named attributes:

    [discount code=ALL_ITEMS] $s * .8 [/discount]

To take 25% off of only item 00-342:

    [discount 00-342] $s * .75 [/discount]

To subtract $5.00 from the customer's order:

    [discount ENTIRE_ORDER] $s - 5 [/discount]

To reset a discount, set it to the empty string:

    [discount ALL_ITEMS][/discount]

Perl code can be used to apply the discounts. Here is an example of a
discount for item code 00-343 which prices the I<second> one ordered
at 1 cent:

    [discount 00-343]
    return $s if $q == 1;
    my $p = $s/$q;
    my $t = ($q - 1) * $p;
    $t .= 0.01;
    return $t;
    [/discount]

If you want to display the discount amount, use the [item-discount]
tag.

    [item-list]
    Discount for [item-code]: [item-discount]
    [/item-list]

Finally, if you want to display the discounted subtotal in a way that
doesn't correspond to a standard Interchange tag, you can use the
[calc] tag:

    [item-list]
    Discounted subtotal for [item-code]: [currency][calc]
                                            [item-price noformat] * [item-quantity]
                                            [/calc][/currency]
    [/item-list]

%% dump %% Prints a dump of the current user session as expanded by
Data::Dumper. Includes any CGI environment passed from the server.

For an example, create a page containing <XMP>[dump]</XMP> and see
what it displays.

%% either %% The C<[either]this[or]that[/either]> implements a check
for the first non-zero, non-blank value. It splits on [or], and then
parses each piece in turn. If a value returns true (in the Perl sense
-- non-zero, non-blank) then subsequent pieces will be discarded
without interpolation.

Example:

  [either][value must_be_here][or][bounce href="[area incomplete]"][/either]

Always strips leading and trailing whitespace.

    )

 OR

    $Tag->error($name, $ATTRHASH);

=item DESCRIPTION

    [error var options]
        var is the error name, e.g. "session"

The [error ...] tag is designed to manage form variable checking for
the Interchange C<submit> form processing action. It works in
conjunction with the definition set in C<mv_order_profile>, and can
generate error messages in any format you desire.

If the variable in question passes order profile checking, it will
output a label, by default B<bold> text if the item is required, or
normal text if not (controlled by the <require> parameter. If the
variable fails one or more order checks, the error message will be
substituted into a template and the error cleared from the user's
session.

(Below is as of 4.03, the equivalent in 4.02 is [if type=explicit
compare="[error all=1 keep=1]"] ... [/if].)

To check errors without clearing them, you can use the idiom:

    [if errors]
    <FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR=RED>
        There were errors in your form submission.
    </FONT>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
        [error all=1 show_error=1 joiner="<BR>"]
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    [/if]

The options are:

=over 8

=item all=1

Display all error messages, not just the one refered to by <var>. The
default is only display the error message assigned to <var>.

text=<optional string to embed the error message(s) in>

place a "%s" somewhere in 'text' to mark where you want the error
message placed, otherwise it's appended on the end. This option also
implies show_error.

=item joiner=<char>

Character used to join multiple error messages. Default is '\n', a
newline.

=item keep=1

keep=1 means don't delete the error messages after copy; anything else
deletes them.

=item show_var=1

show_var=1 means include the variable relating to the error message as
part of the error message (E.g.: "email: not a valid email address".)

show_error=1 show_error=1 means return the error message text;
otherwise just the number of errors found is returned.

=item std_label

std_label=<label string for error message>

used with 'required' to display a standardized error format. The HTML
formating can bet set via the global variable MV_ERROR_STD_LABEL with
the default being:

        <FONT COLOR=RED>label_str<SMALL><I>(%s)</I></SMALL></FONT>

where <label_str> is what you set std_label to and %s is substituted
with the error message. This option can not be used with the text=
option.

=item required=1

Specifies that this is a required field for formatting purposes. In
the std_label format, it means the field will be bolded. If you
specify your own label string, it will insert HTML anywhere you have
{REQUIRED: HTML}, but only when the field is required.

        BODY
    )

 OR

    $Tag->filter($op, $BODY);

=item DESCRIPTION

Applies any of Interchange's standard filters to an arbitray value, or
you may define your own. The filters are also available as parameters
to the C<cgi>, C<data>, and C<value> tags.

Filters can be applied in sequence and as many as needed can be
applied.

Here is an example. If you store your author or artist names in the
database "LAST, First" so that they sort properly, you still might
want to display them normally as "First Last". This call

    [filter op="name namecase"]WOOD, Grant[/filter]

will display as

    Grant Wood

Another way to do this would be:

    [data table=products column=artist key=99-102 filter="name namecase"]

Filters available include:

=over 8

=item cgi

Returns the value of the CGI variable. Useful for starting a filter
sequence with a seed value.

=item lookup

Looks up an item in a database based on the passed table and column.
Call would be:

                },

=item strip

Strips leading and trailing whitespace.

    'strip' =>  sub {

                    return $val;
                },

You can define your own filters in an GlobalSub (or Sub or ActionMap):

    package Vend::Interpolate;

    $Filter{reverse} = sub { $val = shift; return scalar reverse $val  };

That filter will reverse the characters sent.

The arguments sent to the subroutine are the value to be filtered, any
associated variable or tag name, and any arguments appended to the
filter name with periods as the separator.

A C<[filter op=lookup.products.price]99-102[/filter]> will send
('99-102', undef, 'products', 'price') as the parameters. Assuming the
value of the user variable C<foo> is C<bar>, the call C<[value
name=foo filter="lookup.products.price.extra"]> will send ('bar',
'foo', 'products', 'price', 'extra').

=item DESCRIPTION

Syntax: [fly-list prefix=tag_prefix* code=code*]

Defines an area in a random page which performs the flypage lookup
function, implementing the tags below.

   [fly-list]
    (contents of flypage.html)
   [/fly-list]

If you place the above around the contents of the demo flypage, in a
file named C<flypage2.html>, it will make these two calls display
identical pages:

    [page 00-0011] One way to display the Mona Lisa [/page]
    [page flypage2 00-0011] Another way to display the Mona Lisa [/page]

If you place a [fly-list] tag alone at the top of the page, it will
cause any page to act as a flypage.

By default, the prefix is C<item>, meaning the C<[item-code]> tag will
display the code of the item, the C<[item-price]> tag will display
price, etc. But if you use the prefix, i.e. C<[fly-list prefix=fly]>,
then it will be [fly-code]; C<prefix=foo> would cause C<[foo-code]>,
etc.

=item DESCRIPTION

Named call example: [if type="type" term="field" op="op"
compare="compare"]

Positional call example: [if type field op compare]

negated: [if type="!type" term="field" op="op" compare="compare"]

Positional call example: [if !type field op compare]

Allows conditional building of HTML based on the setting of various
Interchange session and database values. The general form is:

    [if type term op compare]
    [then]
                                If true, this is printed on the document.
                                The [then] [/then] is optional in most
                                cases. If ! is prepended to the type
                                setting, the sense is reversed and
                                this will be output for a false condition.
    [/then]
    [elsif type term op compare]
                                Optional, tested when if fails
    [/elsif]
    [else]
                                Optional, printed when all above fail
    [/else]
    [/if]

The C<[if]> tag can also have some variants:

    [if type=explicit compare=`$perl_code`]
        Displayed if valid Perl CODE returns a true value.
    [/if]

You can do some Perl-style regular expressions:

    [if value name =~ /^mike/]
                                This is the if with Mike.
    [elsif value name =~ /^sally/]
                                This is an elsif with Sally.
    [/elsif]
    [elsif value name =~ /^pat/]
                                This is an elsif with Pat.
    [/elsif]
    [else]
                                This is the else, no name I know.
    [/else]
    [/if]

While named parameter tag syntax works for C<[if ...]>, it is more
convenient to use positional calls in most cases. The only exception
is if you are planning on doing a test on the results of another tag
sequence:

    [if value name =~ /[value b_name]/]
        Shipping name matches billing name.
    [/if]

Oops!  This will not work. You must do instead

    [if base=value field=name op="=~" compare="/[value b_name]/"]
        Shipping name matches billing name.
    [/if]

or better yet

    [if type=explicit compare=`
                        $Value->{name} =~ /$Value->{b_name}/
                        `]
        Shipping name matches billing name.
    [/if]

Interchange also supports a limited [and ...] and [or ...] capability:

    [if value name =~ /Mike/]
    [or value name =~ /Jean/]
    Your name is Mike or Jean.
    [/if]

    [if value name =~ /Mike/]
    [and value state =~ /OH/]
    Your name is Mike and you live in Ohio.
    [/if]

If you wish to do very complex AND and OR operations, you will have to
use C<[if explicit]> or better yet embedded Perl/ASP. This allows
complex testing and parsing of values.

There are many test targets available:

=over 8

=item config Directive

The Interchange configuration variables. These are set by the
directives in your Interchange configuration file (or the defaults).

    [if config CreditCardAuto]
    Auto credit card validation is enabled.
    [/if]

=item data  database::field::key

The Interchange databases. Retrieves a field in the database and
returns true or false based on the value.

    [if data products::size::99-102]
    There is size information.
    [else]
    No size information.
    [/else]
    [/if]

    [if data products::size::99-102 =~ /small/i]
    There is a small size available.
    [else]
    No small size available.
    [/else]
    [/if]

=item discount

Checks to see if a discount is present for an item.

    [if discount 99-102]
    Item is discounted.
    [/if]

=item explicit

A test for an explicit value. If perl code is placed between a
[condition] [/condition] tag pair, it will be used to make the
comparison. Arguments can be passed to import data from user space,
just as with the [perl] tag.

    [if explicit]
    [condition]
        $country = '[value country]';
        return 1 if $country =~ /u\.?s\.?a?/i;
        return 0;
    [/condition]
    You have indicated a US address.
    [else]
    You have indicated a non-US address.
    [/else]
    [/if]

This example is a bit contrived, as the same thing could be
accomplished with [if value country =~ /u\.?s\.?a?/i], but you will
run into many situations where it is useful.

This will work for I<Variable> values:

    [if type=explicit compare="__MYVAR__"] .. [/if]

=item file

Tests for existence of a file. Useful for placing image tags only if
the image is present.

    [if file /home/user/www/images/[item-code].gif]
    <IMG SRC="[item-code].gif">
    [/if]

The C<file> test requires that the I<SafeUntrap> directive contains
C<ftfile> (which is the default).

=item items

The Interchange shopping carts. If not specified, the cart used is the
main cart. Usually used as a litmus test to see if anything is in the
cart, for example:

  [if items]You have items in your shopping cart.[/if]

  [if items layaway]You have items on layaway.[/if]

=item ordered

Order status of individual items in the Interchange shopping carts. If
not specified, the cart used is the main cart. The following items
refer to a part number of 99-102.

  [if ordered 99-102] Item 99-102 is in your cart. [/if]
    Checks the status of an item on order, true if item
    99-102 is in the main cart.

  [if ordered 99-102 layaway] ... [/if]
    Checks the status of an item on order, true if item
    99-102 is in the layaway cart.

  [if ordered 99-102 main size] ... [/if]
    Checks the status of an item on order in the main cart,
    true if it has a size attribute.

  [if ordered 99-102 main size =~ /large/i] ... [/if]
    Checks the status of an item on order in the main cart,
    true if it has a size attribute containing 'large'.

    To make sure it is exactly large, you could use:

  [if ordered 99-102 main size eq 'large'] ... [/if]

=item scratch

The Interchange scratchpad variables, which can be set with the [set
name]value[/set] element.

    [if scratch mv_separate_items]
    ordered items will be placed on a separate line.
    [else]
    ordered items will be placed on the same line.
    [/else]
    [/if]

=item session

the interchange session variables. of particular interest are
i<login>, i<frames>, i<secure>, and i<browser>.

=item validcc

a special case, takes the form [if validcc no type exp_date].
evaluates to true if the supplied credit card number, type of card,
and expiration date pass a validity test. does a luhn-10 calculation
to weed out typos or phony card numbers. Uses the standard
C<CreditCardAuto> variables for targets if nothing else is passed.

=item value

the interchange user variables, typically set in search, control, or
order forms. variables beginning with c<mv_> are interchange special
values, and should be tested/used with caution.

=back

The I<field> term is the specifier for that area. For example, [if
session logged_in] would return true if the C<logged_in> session
parameter was set.

As an example, consider buttonbars for frame-based setups. It would be
nice to display a different buttonbar (with no frame targets) for
sessions that are not using frames:

    [if scratch frames]
        __BUTTONBAR_FRAMES__
    [else]
        __BUTTONBAR__
    [/else]
    [/if]

Another example might be the when search matches are displayed. If you
use the string '[value mv_match_count] titles found', it will display
a plural for only one match. Use:

    [if value mv_match_count != 1]
        [value mv_match_count] matches found.
    [else]
        Only one match was found.
    [/else]
    [/if]

The I<op> term is the compare operation to be used. Compare operations
are as in Perl:

    ==  numeric equivalence
    eq  string equivalence
    >   numeric greater-than
    gt  string greater-than
    <   numeric less-than
    lt  string less-than
    !=  numeric non-equivalence
    ne  string equivalence

Any simple perl test can be used, including some limited regex
matching. More complex tests are best done with C<[if explicit]>.

=over 8

=item [then] text [/then]

This is optional if you are not nesting if conditions, as the text
immediately following the [if ..] tag is used as the conditionally
substituted text. If nesting [if ...] tags you should use a
[then][/then] on any outside conditions to ensure proper
interpolation.

=item [elsif type field op* compare*]

named attributes: [elsif type="type" term="field" op="op"
compare="compare"]

Additional conditions for test, applied if the initial C<[if ..]> test
fails.

=item [else] text [/else]

The optional else-text for an if or if_field conditional.

=item [condition] text [/condition]

Only used with the [if explicit] tag. Allows an arbitrary expression
B<in Perl> to be placed inside, with its return value interpreted as
the result of the test. If arguments are added to [if explicit args],
those will be passed as arguments are in the I<[perl]> construct.

=item DESCRIPTION

Named attributes:

    [import table=table_name
            type=(TAB|PIPE|CSV|%%|LINE)
            continue=(NOTES|UNIX|DITTO)
            separator=c]

Import one or more records into a database. The C<type> is any of the
valid Interchange delimiter types, with the default being defined by
the setting of the database I<DELIMITER>. The table must already be a
defined Interchange database table; it cannot be created on the fly.
(If you need that, it is time to use SQL.)

The C<type> of C<LINE> and C<continue> setting of C<NOTES> is
particularly useful, for it allows you to name your fields and not
have to remember the order in which they appear in the database. The
following two imports are identical in effect:

    [import table=orders]
    code: [value mv_order_number]
    shipping_mode: [shipping-description]
    status: pending
    [/import]

    [import table=orders]
    shipping_mode: [shipping-description]
    status: pending
    code: [value mv_order_number]
    [/import]

The C<code> or key must always be present, and is always named
C<code>.

If you do not use C<NOTES> mode, you must import the fields in the
same order as they appear in the ASCII source file.

The C<[import ....] TEXT [/import]> region may contain multiple
records. If using C<NOTES> mode, you must use a separator, which by
default is a form-feed character (^L).

Attribute aliases

            cart ==> name

=item DESCRIPTION

Within any page, the [item_list cart*] element shows a list of all the
items ordered by the customer so far. It works by repeating the source
between [item_list] and [/item_list] once for each item ordered.

NOTE: The special tags that reference item within the list are not
normal Interchange tags, do not take named attributes, and cannot be
contained in an HTML tag (other than to substitute for one of its
values or provide a conditional container). They are interpreted only
inside their corresponding list container. Normal Interchange tags can
be interspersed, though they will be interpreted I<after> all of the
list-specific tags.

Between the item_list markers the following elements will return
information for the current item:

=over 8

=item [if-data table column]

If the database field C<column> in table I<table> is non-blank, the
following text up to the [/if_data] tag is substituted. This can be
used to substitute IMG or other tags only if the corresponding source
item is present. Also accepts a [else]else text[/else] pair for the
opposite condition.

=item [if-data ! table column]

Reverses sense for [if-data].

=item [/if-data]

Terminates an [if_data table column] element.

=item [if-field fieldname]

If the products database field I<fieldname> is non-blank, the
following text up to the [/if_field] tag is substituted. If you have
more than one products database table (see I<ProductFiles>), it will
check them in order until a matching key is found. This can be used to
substitute IMG or other tags only if the corresponding source item is
present. Also accepts a [else]else text[/else] pair for the opposite
condition.

=item [if-field ! fieldname]

Reverses sense for [if-field].

=item [/if-field]

Terminates an [if_field fieldname] element.

=item [item-accessories attribute*, type*, field*, database*, name*]

Evaluates to the value of the Accessories database entry for the item.
If passed any of the optional arguments, initiates special processing
of item attributes based on entries in the product database.

=item [item-code]

Evaluates to the product code for the current item.

=item [item-data database fieldname]

Evaluates to the field name I<fieldname> in the arbitrary database
table I<database>, for the current item.

=item [item-description]

Evaluates to the product description (from the products file) for the
current item.

In support of C<OnFly>, if the description field is not found in the
database, the C<description> setting in the shopping cart will be used
instead.

=item [item-field fieldname]

Evaluates to the field name I<fieldname> in the products database, for
the current item. If the item is not found in the first of the
I<ProductFiles>, all will be searched in sequence.

=item [item-increment]

Evaluates to the number of the item in the match list. Used for
numbering search matches or order items in the list.

=item [item-last]tags[/item-last]

Evaluates the output of the Interchange tags encased inside the tags,
and if it evaluates to a numerical non-zero number (i.e. 1, 23, or -1)
then the list iteration will terminate. If the evaluated number is
B<negative>, then the item itself will be skipped. If the evaluated
number is B<positive>, then the item itself will be shown but will be
last on the list.

      [item-last][calc]
        return -1 if '[item-field weight]' eq '';
        return 1 if '[item-field weight]' < 1;
        return 0;
        [/calc][/item-last]

If this is contained in your C<[item-list]> (or C<[search-list]> or
flypage) and the weight field is empty, then a numerical C<-1> will be
output from the [calc][/calc] tags; the list will end and the item
will B<not> be shown. If the product's weight field is less than 1, a
numerical 1 is output.  The item will be shown, but will be the last
item shown. (If it is an C<[item-list]>, any price for the item will
still be added to the subtotal.) NOTE: no HTML style.

=item [item-modifier attribute]

Evaluates to the modifier value of C<attribute> for the current item.

=item [item-next]tags[/item_next]

Evaluates the output of the Interchange tags encased inside, and if it
evaluates to a numerical non-zero number (i.e. 1, 23, or -1) then the
item will be skipped with no output. Example:

      [item-next][calc][item-field weight] < 1[/calc][/item-next]

If this is contained in your C<[item-list]> (or C<[search-list]> or
flypage) and the product's weight field is less than 1, then a
numerical C<1> will be output from the [calc][/calc] operation. The
item will not be shown. (If it is an C<[item-list]>, any price for the
item will still be added to the subtotal.)

=item [item-price n* noformat*]

Evaluates to the price for quantity C<n> (from the products file) of
the current item, with currency formatting. If the optional "noformat"
is set, then currency formatting will not be applied.

=item [discount-price n* noformat*]

Evaluates to the discount price for quantity C<n> (from the products
file) of the current item, with currency formatting. If the optional
"noformat" is set, then currency formatting will not be applied.
Returns regular price if not discounted.

=item [item-discount]

Returns the difference between the regular price and the discounted
price.

=item [item-quantity]

Evaluates to the quantity ordered for the current item.

=item [item-subtotal]

Evaluates to the subtotal (quantity * price) for the current item.
Quantity price breaks are taken into account.

=item [modifier-name attribute]

Evaluates to the name to give an input box in which the customer can
specify the modifier to the ordered item.

=item [quantity-name]

Evaluates to the name to give an input box in which the customer can
enter the quantity to order.

=item DESCRIPTION

HTML example:

    <TABLE><TR MV="loop 1 2 3"><TD>[loop-code]</TD></TR></TABLE>

Returns a string consisting of the LIST, repeated for every item in a
comma-separated or space-separated list. Operates in the same fashion
as the [item-list] tag, except for order-item-specific values.
Intended to pull multiple attributes from an item modifier -- but can
be useful for other things, like building a pre-ordained product list
on a page.

Loop lists can be nested reliably in Interchange by using the
prefix="tag" parameter. New syntax:

    [loop arg="A B C"]
        [loop prefix=mid arg="[loop-code]1 [loop-code]2 [loop-code]3"]
            [loop prefix=inner arg="X Y Z"]
                [mid-code]-[inner-code]
            [/loop]
        [/loop]
    [/loop]

You can do an arbitrary search with the search="args" parameter, just
as in a one-click search:

    [loop search="se=Americana/sf=category"]
        [loop-code] [loop-field title]
    [/loop]

The above will show all items with a category containing the whole
world "Americana", and will work the same in both old and new syntax.

=over 8

=item [if-loop-data table column] IF [else] ELSE [/else][/if-loop-field]

Outputs the IF if the C<column> in C<table> is non-empty, and the ELSE
(if any) otherwise.

See [if-PREFIX-data].

=item [if-loop-field column] IF [else] ELSE [/else][/if-loop-field]

Outputs the B<IF> if the C<column> in the C<products> table is
non-empty, and the B<ELSE> (if any) otherwise. Will fall through to
the first non-empty field if there are multiple C<ProductFiles>.

See [if-PREFIX-field].

=item [if-loop-param param] IF [else] ELSE [/else][/if-loop-param]

Only works if you have named return fields from a search (or from a
passed list with the lr=1 parameter).

Outputs the B<IF> if the returned C<param> is non-empty, and the
B<ELSE> (if any) otherwise.

See [if-PREFIX-param].

=item [if-loop-pos N] IF [else] ELSE [/else][/if-loop-param]

Only works if you have multiple return fields from a search (or from a
passed list with the lr=1 parameter).

Parameters are numbered from ordinal 0, with [loop-pos 0] being the
equivalent of [loop-code].

Outputs the B<IF> if the returned positional parmeter C<N> is
non-empty, and the B<ELSE> (if any) otherwise.

See [if-PREFIX-pos].

=item [loop-accessories]

Outputs an [accessories ...] item.

See [PREFIX-accessories].

=item [loop-change marker]

See [PREFIX-change].

=item [loop-code]

Evaluates to the code for the current item.

See [PREFIX-code].

=item [loop-data database fieldname]

Evaluates to the field name I<fieldname> in the arbitrary database
table I<database>, for the current item.

See [PREFIX-data].

=item [loop-description]

Evaluates to the product description (from the products file, passed
description in on-fly item, or description attribute in cart) for the
current item.

See [PREFIX-description].

=item [loop-field fieldname]

Evaluates to the field name I<fieldname> in the database,  for the
current item.

See [PREFIX-field].

=item [loop-increment]

Evaluates to the number of the item in the list. Used for numbering
items in the list.

Starts from integer 1.

See [PREFIX-increment].

=item [loop-last]tags[/loop-last]

Evaluates the output of the Interchange tags encased inside, and if it
evaluates to a numerical non-zero number (i.e. 1, 23, or -1) then the
loop iteration will terminate. If the evaluated number is B<negative>,
then the item itself will be skipped. If the evaluated number is
B<positive>, then the item itself will be shown but will be last on
the list.

      [loop-last][calc]
        return -1 if '[loop-field weight]' eq '';
        return 1 if '[loop-field weight]' < 1;
        return 0;
        [/calc][/loop-last]

If this is contained in your C<[loop list]> and the weight field is
empty, then a numerical C<-1> will be output from the [calc][/calc]
tags; the list will end and the item will B<not> be shown. If the
product's weight field is less than 1, a numerical 1 is output.  The
item will be shown, but will be the last item shown.

=item [loop-next]tags[/loop-next]

Evaluates the output of the Interchange tags encased inside, and if it
evaluates to a numerical non-zero number (i.e. 1, 23, or -1) then the
loop will be skipped with no output. Example:

      [loop-next][calc][loop-field weight] < 1[/calc][/loop-next]

If this is contained in your C<[loop list]> and the product's weight
field is less than 1, then a numerical C<1> will be output from the
[calc][/calc] operation. The item will not be shown.

=item [loop-price n* noformat*]

Evaluates to the price for optional quantity n (from the products
file) of the current item, with currency formatting. If the optional
"noformat" is set, then currency formatting will not be applied.

    )

 OR

    $Tag->page($href, $arg, $ATTRHASH);

Attribute aliases

            base ==> arg

=item DESCRIPTION

Insert a hyperlink to the specified catalog page pg. For example,
[page shirts] will expand into < a
href="http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink/shirts?WehUkATn;;1">.
The catalog page displayed will come from "shirts.html" in the pages
directory.

The additional argument will be passed to Interchange and placed in
the {arg} session parameter. This allows programming of a conditional
page display based on where the link came from. The argument is then
available with the tag [data session arg], or the embedded Perl
session variable $Session->{arg}. Spaces and some other characters
will be escaped with the %NN HTTP-style notation and unescaped when
the argument is read back into the session.

A bit of magic occurs if Interchange has built a static plain HTML
page for the target page. Instead of generating a normal
Interchange-parsed page reference, a static page reference will be
inserted if the user has accepted and sent back a cookie with the
session ID.

The optional C<form> argument allows you to encode a form in the link.

        [page form="
                mv_order_item=99-102
                mv_order_size=L
                mv_order_quantity=1
                mv_separate_items=1
                mv_todo=refresh"] Order t-shirt in Large size </A>

The two form values I<mv_session_id> and I<mv_arg> are automatically
added when appropriate. (I<mv_arg> is the C<arg> parameter for the
tag.)

If the parameter C<href> is not supplied, I<process> is used, causing
normal Interchange form processing. If the C<href> points to an
http:// link no Interchange URL processing will be done, but the
mv_session_id

This would generate a form that ordered item number 99-102 on a
separate line (C<mv_separate_items> being set), with size C<L>, in
quantity 2. Since the page is not set, you will go to the default
shopping cart page -- equally you could set C<mv_orderpage=yourpage>
to go to C<yourpage>.

All normal Interchange form caveats apply -- you must have an action,
you must supply a page if you don't want to go to the default, etc.

You can theoretically submit any form with this, though none of the
included values can have newlines or trailing whitespace. If you want
to do something like that you will have to write a UserTag.

Interchange allows you to pass a search in a URL. Just specify the
search with the special page reference C<scan>. Here is an example:

     [page scan
            se=Impressionists
            sf=category]
        Impressionist Paintings
     [/page]

Here is the same thing from a home page (assuming /cgi-bin/vlink is
the CGI path for Interchange's vlink):

     <A HREF="/cgi-bin/vlink/scan/se=Impressionists/sf=category">
        Impressionist Paintings
     </A>

Sometimes, you will find that you need to pass characters that will
not be interpreted positionally. In that case, you should quote the
arguments:

    [page href=scan
          arg=|
                se="Something with spaces"
          |]

The two-letter abbreviations are mapped with these letters:

  DL  mv_raw_dict_look
  MM  mv_more_matches
  SE  mv_raw_searchspec
  ac  mv_all_chars
  ar  mv_arg

They can be treated just the same as form variables on the page,
except that they can't contain spaces, '/' in a file name, or quote
marks. These characters can be used in URL hex encoding, i.e. %20 is a
space, %2F is a C</>, etc. -- C<&sp;> or C<&#32;> will not be
recognized. If you use one of the methods below to escape these
"unsafe" characters, you won't have to worry about this.

You may specify a one-click search in three different ways. The first
is as used in previous versions, with the scan URL being specified
completely as the page name.  The second two use the "argument"
parameter to the C<[page ...]> or C<[area ...]> tags to specify the
search (an argument to a scan is never valid anyway).

=over 8

=item Original

If you wish to do an OR search on the fields category and artist for
the strings "Surreal" and "Gogh", while matching substrings, you would
do:

 [page scan se=Surreal/se=Gogh/os=yes/su=yes/sf=artist/sf=category]
    Van Gogh -- compare to surrealists
 [/page]

In this method of specification, to replace a / (slash) in a file name
(for the sp, bd, or fi parameter) you must use the shorthand of ::,
i.e. sp=results::standard. (This may not work for some browsers, so
you should probably either put the page in the main pages directory or
define the page in a search profile.)

=item Ampersand

You can substitute & for / in the specification and be able to use /
and quotes and spaces in the specification.

 [page scan se="Van Gogh"&sp=lists/surreal&os=yes&su=yes&sf=artist&sf=category]
    Van Gogh -- compare to surrealists
 [/page]

Any "unsafe" characters will be escaped.

=item Multi-line

You can specify parameters one to a line, as well.

    [page scan
        se="Van Gogh"
        sp=lists/surreal
        os=yes
        su=yes
        sf=artist
        sf=category
    ] Van Gogh -- compare to surrealists [/page]

Any "unsafe" characters will be escaped. You may not search for
trailing spaces in this method; it is allowed in the other notations.

=back

New syntax and old syntax handle the tags the same, though if by some
odd chance you wanted to be able to search for a C<]> (right square
bracket) you would need to use new syntax.

The optional I<arg> is used just as in the I<page> tag.

=item [/page]

Expands into </a>. Used with the page element, such as:

  [page shirts]Our shirt collection[/page].

TIP: A small efficiency boost in large pages is to just use the </A>
tag.

If you wish to use database values in your Perl code, you must
pre-open the table(s) you will be using. This can be done by including
the table name in the C<tables> parameter of the Perl tag:

    [perl tables=products]
        $result = "You asked about $Values->{code}. Here is the description: ";
        $result .= $Tag->data('products', 'description', $Values->{code});
        return $result;

If you do not do this, your code will fail with a runtime Safe error.

=item DESCRIPTION

Arguments:

        code       Product code/SKU
        base       Only search in product table *base*
        quantity   Price for a quantity
        discount   If true(1), check discount coupons and apply
        noformat   If true(1), don't apply currency formatting

Expands into the price of the product identified by code as found in
the products database. If there is more than one products file
defined, they will be searched in order unless constrained by the
optional argument B<base>. The optional argument B<quantity> selects
an entry from the quantity price list. To receive a raw number, with
no currency formatting, use the option C<noformat=1>.

Interchange maintains a price in its database for every product. The
price field is the one required field in the product database -- it is
necessary to build the price routines.

For speed, Interchange builds the code that is used to determine a
product's price at catalog configuration time. If you choose to change
a directive that affects product pricing you must reconfigure the
catalog.

Quantity price breaks are configured by means of the I<CommonAdjust>
directive. There are a number of CommonAdjust recipes which can be
used; the standard example in the demo calls for a separate pricing
table called C<pricing>. Observe the following:

   CommonAdjust  pricing:q2,q5,q10,q25, ;products:price, ==size:pricing

This says to check quantity and find the applicable column in the
pricing database and apply it. In this case, it would be:

    2-4      Column *q2*
    5-9      Column *q5*
    10-24    Column *q10*
    25 up    Column *q25*

What happens if quantity is one? It "falls back" to the price that is
in the table C<products>, column C<price>.

After that, if there is a size attribute for the product, the column
in the pricing database corresponding to that column is checked for
additions or subtractions (or even percentage changes).

If you use this tag in the demo:

    [price code=99-102 quantity=10 size=XL]

the price will be according to the C<q10> column, adjusted by what is
in the XL column. (The row is of course 99-102.) The following entry
in pricing:

  code    q2   q5   q10  q25  XL
  99-102  10   9    8    7    .50

Would yield 8.50 for the price. Quantity of 10 in the C<q10> column,
with 50 cents added for extra large (XL).

Following are several examples based on the above entry as well as
this the entry in the C<products> table:

  code    description   price    size
  99-102  T-Shirt       10.00    S=Small, M=Medium, L=Large*, XL=Extra Large

NOTE: The examples below assume a US locale with 2 decimal places, use
of commas to separate, and a dollar sign ($) as the currency
formatting.

Product discounts for specific products, all products, or the entire
order can be configured with the [discount ...] tag. Discounts are
applied on a per-user basis -- you can gate the discount based on
membership in a club or other arbitrary means.

Adding [discount 99-102] $s * .9[/discount] deducts 10% from the price
at checkout, but the price tag will not show that unless you add the
discount=1 parameter.

    [price code="99-102"]            -->   $10.00
    [price code="99-102" discount=1] -->   $9.00

=item DESCRIPTION

Formats text in tables. Intended for use in emailed reports or
<PRE></PRE> HTML areas. The parameter I<nn> gives the number of
columns to use. Inside the row tag, [col param=value ...] tags may be
used.

=over 8

=item [col width=nn wrap=yes|no gutter=n align=left|right|input spacing=n]

Sets up a column for use in a [row]. This parameter can only be
contained inside a [row nn] [/row] tag pair. Any number of columns
(that fit within the size of the row) can be defined.

The parameters are:

    width=nn        The column width, I<including the gutter>. Must be
                    supplied, there is no default. A shorthand method
                    is to just supply the number as the I<first> parameter,
                    as in [col 20].

    gutter=n        The number of spaces used to separate the column (on
                    the right-hand side) from the next. Default is 2.

    spacing=n       The line spacing used for wrapped text. Default is 1,
                    or single-spaced.

    wrap=(yes|no)   Determines whether text that is greater in length than
                    the column width will be wrapped to the next line. Default
                    is I<yes>.

    align=(L|R|I)   Determines whether text is aligned to the left (the default),
                    the right, or in a way that might display an HTML text
                    input field correctly.

=item [/col]

    )

 OR

    $Tag->selected($name, $value, $ATTRHASH);

=item DESCRIPTION

You can provide a "memory" for drop-down menus, radio buttons, and
checkboxes with the [checked] and [selected] tags.

This will output SELECTED if the variable C<var_name> is equal to
C<value>. If the optional MULTIPLE argument is present, it will look
for any of a variety of values. Not case sensitive unless the optional
C<case=1> parameter is used.

Here is a drop-down menu that remembers an item-modifier color
selection:

    <SELECT NAME="color">
    <OPTION [selected color blue]> Blue
    <OPTION [selected color green]> Green
    <OPTION [selected color red]> Red
    </SELECT>

Here is the same thing, but for a shopping-basket color selection

    <SELECT NAME="[modifier-name color]">
    <OPTION [selected [modifier-name color] blue]> Blue
    <OPTION [selected [modifier-name color] green]> Green
    <OPTION [selected [modifier-name color] red]> Red
    </SELECT>

By default, the Values space (i.e. [value foo]) is checked -- if you
want to use the volatile CGI space (i.e. [cgi foo]) use the option
C<cgi=1>.

Pass attribute hash as last to subroutine: B<no>

Must pass named parameter interpolate=1 to cause interpolation.

This is a container tag, i.e. [set] FOO [/set]. Nesting: NO

Invalidates cache: B<YES>

Called Routine:

        BODY
    )

 OR

    $Tag->set($name, $BODY);

=item DESCRIPTION

Sets a scratch variable to I<value>.

Most of the mv_* variables that are used for search and order
conditionals are in another namespace -- they can be set by means of
hidden fields in a form.

You can set an order profile with:

  [set checkout]
  name=required
  address=required
  [/set]
  <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=mv_order_profile VALUE="checkout">

A search profile would be set with:

  [set substring_case]
  mv_substring_match=yes
  mv_case=yes
  [/set]
  <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=mv_profile VALUE="substring_case">

Any of these profile values can be set in the OrderProfile files as
well.

=item DESCRIPTION

Performs any of a number of operations, based on the presence of
C<arg>. The arguments that may be given are:

=over 8

=item export database file* type*

Exports a complete Interchange database to its text source file (or
any specified file). The integer C<n>, if specified, will select
export in one of the enumerated Interchange export formats. The
following tag will export the products database to products.txt (or
whatever you have defined its source file as), in the format specified
by the I<Database> directive:

    [tag export products][/tag]

Same thing, except to the file products/new_products.txt:

    [tag export products products/newproducts.txt][/tag]

Same thing, except the export is done with a PIPE delimiter:

    [tag export products products/newproducts.txt 5][/tag]

The file is relative to the catalog directory, and only may be an
absolute path name if I<NoAbsolute> is set to C<No>.

=item flag arg

Sets an Interchange condition.

The following enables writes on the C<products> and C<sizes> databases
held in Interchange internal DBM format:

    [tag flag write]products sizes[/tag]

SQL databases are always writable if allowed by the SQL database
itself -- in-memory databases will never be written.

The [tag flag build][/tag] combination forces static build of a page,
even if dynamic elements are contained. Similarly, the [tag flag
cache][/tag] forces search or page caching (not usually wise).

=item log dir/file

Logs a message to a file, fully interpolated for Interchange tags. The
following tag will send every item code and description in the user's
shopping cart to the file logs/transactions.txt:

    [tag log logs/transactions.txt]
    [item_list][item-code]  [item-description]
    [/item_list][/tag]

The file is relative to the catalog directory, and only may be an
absolute path name if I<NoAbsolute> is set to C<No>.

=item mime description_string

Returns a MIME-encapsulated message with the boundary as employed in
the other mime tags, and the C<description_string> used as the
Content-Description. For example

   [tag mime My Plain Text]Your message here.[/tag]

will return

  Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII
  Content-ID: [sequential, lead as in mime boundary]
  Content-Description: My Plain Text

  Your message here.

When used in concert with [tag mime boundary], [tag mime header], and
[tag mime id], allows MIME attachments to be included -- typically
with PGP-encrypted credit card numbers. See the demo page
ord/report.html for an example.

=item mime boundary

Returns a MIME message boundary with unique string keyed on session
ID, page count, and time.

=item mime header

Returns a MIME message header with the proper boundary for that
session ID, page count, and time.

=item mime id

Returns a MIME message id with the proper boundary for that session
ID, page count, and time.

=item show_tags

The encased text will not be substituted for with Interchange tags,
with < and [ characters changed to C<&>#lt; and C<&>#91; respectively.

    [tag show_tags][value whatever][/tag]

=item time

Formats the current time according to POSIX strftime arguments. The
following is the string for Thursday, April 30, 1997.

    [tag time]%A, %B %d, %Y[/tag]

=item touch

Touches a database to allow use of the tag_data() routine in
user-defined subroutines.  If this is not done, the routine will error
out if the database has not previously been accessed on the page.

    [tag touch products][/tag]

=item DESCRIPTION

Formats the current time according to POSIX strftime arguments. The
following is the string for Monday, January 1, 2001.

    [time]%A, %B %d, %Y[/tag]

See the C<strftime> man page for information on the arguments (which
are the same as modern UNIX date commands).

Accepts the following options:

=over 8

=item adjust

If you wish to temporarily adjust the time for display purposes, you
can pass an C<adjust> parameter with the number of hours (plus or
minus) from the local time or from GMT:

        [time]%c[/time]
        [time adjust="-3"]%c[/time]

Will display:

 Mon 01 Jan 2001 11:29:03 AM EST
 Mon 01 Jan 2001 08:29:03 AM EST

Note that the time zone does not change -- you should either pick a
format which doesn't display zone, use the C<tz> parameter, or manage
it yourself.

NOTE: You can adjust time globally for an Interchange installation by
setting the $ENV{TZ} variable on many systems. Set TZ in your
environment and then restart interchange:

        ## bash/ksh/sh
        TZ=PST7PDT; export TZ
        interchange -restart

        ## csh/tcsh
        setenv TZ PST7PDT
        interchange -restart

On most modern UNIX systems, all times will now be in the PST zone.

=item gmt

If you want to display time as GMT, use the C<gmt> parameter:

        [time]%c[/time]
        [time gmt=1]%c[/time]

will display:

        Mon 01 Jan 2001 11:33:26 AM EST
        Mon 01 Jan 2001 04:33:26 PM EST

Once again, the zone will not be set to GMT, so you should pick a
format string which doesn't use zone, use the C<tz> parameter, or
manage it yourself.

=item locale

Format the time according to the named C<locale>, assuming that locale
is available on your operating system. For example, the following:

        [time locale=en_US]%B %d, %Y[/time]
        [time locale=fr_FR]%B %d, %Y[/time]

should display:

        January 01, 2001
        janvier 01, 2001

=item tz

Use the passed C<tz> to display the time. Will adjust for hours
difference.

Example:

        [time tz=GMT0]
        [time tz=CST6CDT]
        [time tz=PST8PDT]

will display:

        Mon 01 Jan 2001 04:43:02 PM GMT
        Mon 01 Jan 2001 10:43:02 AM CST
        Mon 01 Jan 2001 08:43:02 AM PST

Note that the first alphabetical string is the zone name when not
under daylight savings time, the digit is the number of hours
displacement from GMT, and the second alphabetical string is the zone
name when in daylight savings time. NOTE: This may not work on all
operating systems.

=head2 timed_build

=over 4

=item CALL INFORMATION

Parameters: B<file>

Positional parameters in same order.

B<The attribute hash reference is passed> after the parameters but
before the container text argument. B<This may mean that there are
parameters not shown here.>

Must pass named parameter interpolate=1 to cause interpolation.

This is a container tag, i.e. [timed_build] FOO [/timed_build].
Nesting: NO

Invalidates cache: B<no>

Called Routine:

ASP/perl tag calls:

    $Tag->timed_build(
        {
         file => VALUE,
        },
        BODY
    )

 OR

    $Tag->timed_build($file, $ATTRHASH, $BODY);

=item DESCRIPTION

Allows you to build CPU-intensive regions of ITL tags on a timed
basis.

In the simplest case, surround a region of ITL with C<[timed-build]>
and C<[/timed-build]>:

        [timed-build]
                Built at [time]%c[/time].
        [/timed-build]

If a C<file> parameter is not passed, saves to the directory I<timed>
in catalog root, with the file name of the current page. If the
C<minutes> parameter is not passed specifying how often the page
should be rebuilt, then it will not be rebuilt until the output file
is removed.

Accepts the following parameters:

=over 8

=item file

Name of the file to save the results in. Relative to catalog root. The
directory must exist.

=item if

Allows you to to only display the cached region when the C<if>
paremeter is true. For example, you can do:

        [timed-build if="[value timed]"]
        ITL tags....
        [/timed-build]

The cached region will only be displayed if the variable C<timed> is
set to a non-zero, non-blank value. Otherwise, the ITL tags will be
re-interpreted every time.

=item minutes

The number of minutes after which the timed build should be repeated.
If set to 0, it will be built once and then not rebuilt until the
output file is removed.

=item period

Alternative way of expressing time. You can pass a string describing
the rebuild time period:

        [timed-build period="4 hours"]
        ITL tags....
        [/timed-build]

This is really the same as C<minutes=240>. Useful for passing seconds:

        [timed-build period="5 seconds"]
        ITL tags....
        [/timed-build]

The region will be rebuilt every 5 seconds. PERFORMANCE TIP: use
minutes of .08 instead; avoids having to parse the period string.

=back

If you have the StaticDir catalog.cfg parameter set to a writable
path, you can build a cached static version of your catalog over time.
Simply place a [timed-build] tag at the top of pages you wish to build
statically. Assuming the catalog is not busy and write lock can be
obtained, the StaticDBM database will be updated to mark the page as
static and the next time a link is made for that page the static
version will be presented.

=head2 tmp

=over 4

=item CALL INFORMATION

Parameters: B<name>

Positional parameters in same order.

Pass attribute hash as last to subroutine: B<no>

Interpolates B<container text> by default>.

This is a container tag, i.e. [tmp] FOO [/tmp]. Nesting: NO

Invalidates cache: B<YES>

Called Routine:

ASP/perl tag calls:

    $Tag->tmp(

    )

 OR

    $Tag->tmp($name, $BODY);

=item DESCRIPTION

Sets a scratch variable to I<value>, but at the end of the user
session the Scratch key is deleted. This saves session write time in
many cases.

This tag interpolates automatically. (Interpolation can be turned off
with C<interpolate=0>.)

IMPORTANT NOTE: the [tmp ...][/tmp] tag is not appropriate for setting
order profiles or C<mv_click> actions. If you want to avoid that, use
a profile stored via the catalog.cfg directive C<OrderProfile>.

            sub ==> subordinate

=item DESCRIPTION

Provides iterative list capability for binary trees.  It produces
hash-based rows use the same tags as C<[item-list]>; sets some
additional hash key entries to describe the tree and provide display
control.

Works on a data set with the structure:

    parent  child
    99      a
    a       b
    a       c
    a       d

    99      o
    o       e
    o       f
    o       g

Sets several keys which assist in walking and displaying the tree.

=over 8

=item mv_level

Level of the item. If it is in the first level, it is 0.  Sublevels
are infinite (except for performance).

=item mv_increment

Increment label for the item. Normally goes from 1...n, but can be
changed to A...Z or a...z in outline mode.

=item mv_children

If in autodetect mode, set to the number of children this branch has.
If a leaf, set to 0.

=item mv_spacing

A multiple of level times the spacing option. Useful for setting width
of spacer images.

The above sample data would produce:

    a           mv_level=0, mv_increment=1, mv_children=4
        b       mv_level=1, mv_increment=1, mv_children=0

        </tr>
        [/tree]
        </table>

Accepts the following paremeters:

=over 12

=item table


Database table which contains the tree. Must be a valid Interchange
table identifier.


=item parent


The column which is used to determine the parent of the item.


=item subordinate


The child column, which determines which items are sub-items of the
current one. Used to re-query for items with its value in C<parent>.


=item start_item


The first item to be followed, i.e. the C<parent> value of all the
top-level items.


=item autodetect


Specifies that the next level should be followed to detect the number
of child items contained. Not recursive; only follows far enough to
determine the children of the current item.


=item full


Specifies that all items should be followed. Essentially the same as
specifying C<memo> and passing the C<explode> variable, but not
dependent on them. Useful for building lists for inclusion in embedded
Perl, among other things.


=item stop


An optional C<stop> field which, when the value is true, can stop the
following of the branch.


=item continue


An optional C<continue> field which, when the value is true, can force
the branch to be followed.


=item sort


The column which should be used for ordering the items -- determines
the order in which they will be displayed under the current parent.


=item outline


Sets outline mode, where C<mv_increment> will be displayed with letter
values or numeral values. If set to specifically C<1>, will produced
outline increments like:

    1
        A
        B
            1
            2
        C
            1
            2
                a
                b
                    1
                    2
                        a
                        b
    2


=item memo


Indicates that the collapse/explode/toggle features are to be used,
and names a C<Scratch> variable where the values should be stored.


=item collapse


The name of a variable in the user's session which will determine that
the tree should be "collapsed". When collapsed, the child items will
not be followed unless they are set to be followed with C<toggle>.
Zeros all toggles.


Requires C<memo> to be set if values are to be retained.


=item toggle


The name of a variable in the user's session which will determine that
the current item should be either followed or not followed. The first
time the C<toggle> variable corresponding to its primary key is
passed, the item will be expanded. The next call will "collapse" the
item.


Requires C<memo> to be set if values are to be retained.


=item explode


The name of a variable in the user's session which will determine that
the tree should be "exploded". When exploded, all child items are
followed and the full tree can be displayed.


Requires C<memo> to be set if values are to be retained.


=item pedantic


When set to a true value, and an endless tree is detected (i.e. the
child branch contains a parent) then the error will be logged to the
catalog error log and the tree call will return with an error.


If C<pedantic> is not set (the default), the current leaf will be
shown but never followed. This allows partial display of the tree.


=item log_error


When set to a true value, and an endless tree is detected (i.e. the
child branch contains a parent) then the error will be logged to the
catalog error log. No logging done by default.


=item show_error


When set to a true value, and an endless tree is detected (i.e. the
child branch contains a parent) then the error will be returned in the
page.  Errors are NOT shown by default.

=back

In addition to the above values, all valid options for a list tag are
in force. For example, you can set a "SELECTED" value on an option
list with C<option=1>, set the tag prefix with C<prefix>, etc.

Interchange provides a C<[userdb ...]> tag to access the UserDB
functions.

 [userdb
        function=function_name
        username="username"*
        password="password"*
        verify="password"*

        param1=value*
        param2=value*
        ...
        ]

* Optional

It is normally called in an C<mv_click> or C<mv_check> setting, as in:

    [set Login]
    mv_todo=return
    mv_nextpage=welcome
    [userdb function=login]
    [/set]

    <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=mv_click VALUE=Login>
    Username <INPUT NAME=mv_username SIZE=10>
    Password <INPUT NAME=mv_password SIZE=10>
    </FORM>

There are several global parameters that apply to any use of the
C<userdb> functions. Most importantly, by default the database table
is set to be I<userdb>. If you must use another table name, then you
should include a C<database=table> parameter with any call to
C<userdb>. The global parameters (default in parens):

    database     Sets user database table (userdb)
    show         Show the return value of certain functions
                 or the error message, if any (0)
    force_lower  Force possibly upper-case database fields
                 to lower case session variable names (0)
    billing      Set the billing fields (see Accounts)
    shipping     Set the shipping fields (see Address Book)
    preferences  Set the preferences fields (see Preferences)
    bill_field   Set field name for accounts (accounts)
    addr_field   Set field name for address book (address_book)
    pref_field   Set field name for preferences (preferences)
    cart_field   Set field name for cart storage (carts)
    pass_field   Set field name for password (password)
    time_field   Set field for storing last login time (time)

=item DESCRIPTION

HTML examples:

   <PARAM MV="value name">
   <INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="name" VALUE="[value name]">

Expands into the current value of the customer/form input field named
by field. If C<flag> is present, single quotes will be escaped with a
backslash; this allows you to contain the C<[value ...]> tag within
single quotes. (It is somewhat better to use other quoting methods.)
When the value is returned, any Interchange tags present in the value
will be escaped. This prevents users from entering Interchange tags in
form values, which would be a serious security risk.

If the C<set> value is present, the form variable value will be set to
it and the empty string returned. Use this to "uncheck" a checkbox or
set other form variable values to defaults. B<NOTE:> This is only
available in new-style tags, for safety reasons.

=item DESCRIPTION

Named call example:

   [value-extended
            name=formfield
            outfile=filename*
            ascii=1*

            index="N|N..N|*"
            file_contents=1*
            elements=1*]

Expands into the current value of the customer/form input field named
by field. If there are multiple elements of that variable, it will
return the value at C<index>; by default all joined together with a
space.

If the variable is a file variable coming from a multipart/form-data
file upload, then the contents of that upload can be returned to the
page or optionally written to the C<outfile>.

=over 12

=item name


The form variable NAME. If no other parameters are present, then the
value of the variable will be returned. If there are multiple
elements, then by default they will all be returned joined by a space.
If C<joiner> is present, then they will be joined by its value.


In the special case of a file upload, the value returned is the name
of the file as passed for upload.


=item joiner


The character or string that will join the elements of the array. Will
accept string literals such as "\n" or "\r".


=item test


Three tests -- C<isfile> returns true if the variable is a file
upload. C<length> returns the length. C<defined> returns whether the
value has ever been set at all on a form.


=item index


The index of the element to return if not all are wanted. This is
useful especially for pre-setting multiple search variables. If set to
C<*>, will return all (joined by C<joiner>). If a range, such as C<0
.. 2>, will return multiple elements.


=item file_contents


Returns the contents of a file upload if set to a non-blank, non-zero
value. If the variable is not a file, returns nothing.


=item outfile


Names a file to write the contents of a file upload to. It will not
accept an absolute file name; the name must be relative to the catalog
directory. If you wish to write images or other files that would go to
HTML space, you must use the HTTP server's C<Alias> facilities or make
a symbolic link.


=item ascii


To do an auto-ASCII translation before writing the C<outfile>, set the
C<ascii> parameter to a non-blank, non-zero value. Default is no
translation.


=item yes


The value that will be returned if a test is true or a file is written
successfully. Defaults to C<1> for tests and the empty string for

=head1 User-defined Tags

=over 4

=item

To define a tag that is catalog-specific, place I<UserTag> directives
in your catalog.cfg file. For server-wide tags, define them in
interchange.cfg. Catalog-specific tags take precedence if both are
defined -- in fact, you can override the base Interchange tag set with
them. The directive takes the form:

   UserTag  tagname  property  value

where C<tagname> is the name of the tag, C<property> is the attribute
(described below), and C<value> is the value of the property for that
tagname.

The user tags can either be based on Perl subroutines or just be
aliases for existing tags. Some quick examples are below.

An alias:

    UserTag product_name Alias     data products title

This will change [product_name 99-102] into [data products title
99-102], which will output the C<title> database field for product
code C<99-102>. Don't use this with C<[item-data ...]> and
C<[item-field ...]>, as they are parsed separately.  You can do
C<[product-name [item-code]]>, though.

A simple subroutine:

    UserTag company_name Routine   sub { "Your company name" }

When you place a [company-name] tag in an Interchange page, the text
C<Your company name> will be substituted.

A subroutine with a passed text as an argument:

    UserTag caps   Routine   sub { return "\U@_" }
    UserTag caps   HasEndTag

The tag [caps]This text should be all upper case[/caps] will become
C<THIS TEXT SHOULD BE ALL UPPER CASE>.

Here is a useful one you might wish to use:

    UserTag quick_table HasEndTag
    UserTag quick_table Interpolate
    UserTag quick_table Order   border
    UserTag quick_table Routine <<EOF
    sub {
        my ($border,$input) = @_;
        $border = " BORDER=$border" if $border;
        my $out = "<TABLE ALIGN=LEFT$border>";
        my @rows = split /\n+/, $input;
        my ($left, $right);
        for(@rows) {
            $out .= '<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP>';
            ($left, $right) = split /\s*:\s*/, $_, 2;
            $out .= '<B>' unless $left =~ /</;
            $out .= $left;
            $out .= '</B>' unless $left =~ /</;
            $out .= '</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>';
            $out .= $right;
            $out .= '</TD></TR>';
            $out .= "\n";
        }
        $out .= '</TABLE>';
    }
    EOF

Called with:

    [quick-table border=2]
    Name: [value name]
    City: [value city][if value state], [value state][/if] [value country]
    [/quick_table]

The properties for UserTag are are:

=over 8

=item Alias

An alias for an existing (or other user-defined) tag. It takes the
form:

    UserTag tagname Alias    tag to insert

An Alias is the only property that does not require a I<Routine> to
process the tag.

=item attrAlias

An alias for an existing attribute for defined tag. It takes the form:

    UserTag tagname attrAlias   alias attr

As an example, the standard Interchange C<value> tag takes a named
attribute of C<name> for the variable name, meaning that C<[value
name=var]> will display the value of form field C<var>. If you put
this line in catalog.cfg:

    UserTag value attrAlias   identifier name

then C<[value identifier=var]> will be an equivalent tag.

=item CanNest

Notifies Interchange that this tag must be checked for nesting. Only
applies to tags that have I<HasEndTag> defined, of course. NOTE: Your
routine must handle the subtleties of nesting, so don't use this
unless you are quite conversant with parsing routines.  See the
routines C<tag_loop_list> and C<tag_if> in lib/Vend/Interpolate.pm for
an example of a nesting tag.

    UserTag tagname CanNest

=item HasEndTag

Defines an ending [/tag] to encapsulate your text -- the text in
between the beginning C<[tagname]> and ending C<[/tagname]> will be
the last argument sent to the defined subroutine.

    UserTag tagname HasEndTag

=item Implicit

This defines a tag as implicit, meaning it can just be an C<attribute>
instead of an C<attribute=value> pair. It must be a recognized
attribute in the tag definition, or there will be big problems. Use
this with caution!

    UserTag tagname Implicit attribute value

If you want to set a standard include file to a fixed value by
default, but don't want to have to specify C<[include
file="/long/path/to/file"]> every time, you can just put:

    UserTag include Implicit file file=/long/path/to/file

and C<[include file]> will be the equivalent. You can still specify
another value with C[include file="/another/path/to/file"]

=item InsertHTML

This attribute makes HTML tag output be inserted into the containing
tag, in effect adding an attribute=value pair (or pairs).

    UserTag tagname InsertHTML   htmltag  mvtag|mvtag2|mvtagN

In Interchange's standard tags, among others, the <OPTION ...> tag has
the [selected ..] and [checked ...] tags included with them, so that
you can do:

   <INPUT TYPE=checkbox
        MV="checked mvshipmode upsg" NAME=mv_shipmode> UPS Ground shipping

to expand to this:

   <INPUT TYPE=checkbox CHECKED NAME=mv_shipmode> UPS Ground shipping

Providing, of course, that C<mv_shipmode> B<is> equal to C<upsg>. If
you want to turn off this behavior on a per-tag basis, add the
attribute mv.noinsert=1 to the tag on your page.

=item InsideHTML

To make a container tag be placed B<after> the containing HTML tag,
use the InsideHTML setting.

    UserTag tagname InsideHTML   htmltag  mvtag|mvtag2|mvtagN

In Interchange's standard tags, the only InsideHTML tag is the
<SELECT> tag when used with I<loop>, which causes this:

   <SELECT MV="loop upsg upsb upsr" NAME=mv_shipmode>
   <OPTION VALUE="[loop-code]"> [shipping-desc [loop-code]]
   </SELECT>

to expand to this:

   <SELECT NAME=mv_shipmode>
   [loop upsg upsb upsr]
   <OPTION VALUE="[loop-code]"> [shipping-desc [loop-code]]
   [/loop]
   </SELECT>

Without the InsideHTML setting, the [loop ...] would have been
B<outside> of the select -- not what you want.  If you want to turn
off this behavior on a per-tag basis, add the attribute mv.noinside=1
to the tag on your page.

=item Interpolate

The behavior for this attribute depends on whether the tag is a
container (i.e. C<HasEndTag> is defined). If it is not a container,
the C<Interpolate> attribute causes the B<the resulting HTML> from the
C<UserTag> will be re-parsed for more Interchange tags.  If it is a
container, C<Interpolate> causes the contents of the tag to be parsed
B<before> the tag routine is run.

    UserTag tagname Interpolate

=item InvalidateCache

If this is defined, the presence of the tag on a page will prevent
search cache, page cache, and static builds from operating on the
page.

    UserTag tagname InvalidateCache

It does not override [tag flag build][/tag], though.

=item Order

The optional arguments that can be sent to the tag. This defines not
only the order in which they will be passed to I<Routine>, but the
name of the tags. If encapsulated text is appropriate (I<HasEndTag> is
set), it will be the last argument.

    UserTag tagname Order param1 param2

=item PosRoutine

Identical to the Routine argument -- a subroutine that will be called
when the new syntax is not used for the call, i.e. C<[usertag
argument]> instead of C<[usertag ARG=argument]>. If not defined,
I<Routine> is used, and Interchange will usually do the right thing.

=item ReplaceAttr

Works in concert with InsertHTML, defining a B<single> attribute which
will be replaced in the insertion operation..

  UserTag tagname ReplaceAttr  htmltag attr

An example is the standard HTML <A HREF=...> tag. If you want to use
the Interchange tag C<[area pagename]> inside of it, then you would
normally want to replace the HREF attribute. So the equivalent to the
following is defined within Interchange:

  UserTag  area  ReplaceAttr  a  href

Causing this

    <A MV="area pagename" HREF="a_test_page.html">

to become

    <A HREF="http://yourserver/cgi/simple/pagename?X8sl2lly;;44">

when intepreted.

=item ReplaceHTML

For HTML-style tag use only. Causes the tag containing the Interchange
tag to be stripped and the result of the tag to be inserted, for
certain tags. For example:

  UserTag company_name Routine sub { my $l = shift; return "$l: XYZ Company" }
  UserTag company_name HasEndTag
  UserTag company_name ReplaceHTML  b    company_name

<BR> is the HTML tag, and "company_name" is the Interchange tag. At
that point, the usage:

    <B MV="company-name"> Company </B>  --->>  Company: XYZ Company

Tags not in the list will not be stripped:

    <I MV="company-name"> Company </I> --->>  <I>Company: XYZ Company</I>

=item Routine

An inline subroutine that will be used to process the arguments of the
tag. It must not be named, and will be allowed to access unsafe
elements only if the C<interchange.cfg> parameter I<AllowGlobal> is
set for the catalog.

    UserTag tagname Routine  sub { "your perl code here!" }

The routine may use a "here" document for readability:

    UserTag tagname Routine <<EOF
    sub {
        my ($param1, $param2, $text) = @_;
        return "Parameter 1 is $param1, Parameter 2 is $param2";
    }
    EOF

The usual I<here documents> caveats apply.

Parameters defined with the I<Order> property will be sent to the
routine first, followed by any encapsulated text (I<HasEndTag> is
set).

=back

Note that the UserTag facility, combined with AllowGlobal, allows the
user to define tags just as powerful as the standard Interchange tags.
This is not recommended for the novice, though -- keep it simple. 8-)
