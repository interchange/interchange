Interchange Templates

=head1 Interchange Templates

Interchange is the industry's most widely distributed and implemented
open source e-commerce platform. Interchange is designed to build
pages based on templates from a database. This document discusses, in
detail, how to build forms and report templates with Interchange's tag
language, ITL (Interchange Tag Language).

=head2 Overview

The search builder can be used to generate very complex reports on the
database, or to help in the construction of ITL templates. Select a
"Base table" which will be the foundation for the report. Specify the
maximum number of rows to be returned at once, and whether to show
only unique entries.

The "Search filter" narrows down the list of rows returned by matching
columns of the table based on various criteria. Up to three separate
conditions may be specified. The returned rows must match all
criteria.

Finally, select any sorting options desired for displaying the
results, and narrow down the list of columns returned if desired.
Clicking "Run" will run the search immediately and display the
results. "Generate definition" will display an ITL tag which can be
placed in a template and which will return the results when executed.

To build complex order forms and reports, Interchange has a complete
tag language with over 80 different functions, dubbed ITL, for
Interchange Tag Language. It allows access to and control over any of
an unlimited number of database tables, multiple shopping carts, user
name/address information, discount, tax, and shipping information,
search of files and databases, and much more.

There is some limited conditional capability with the C<[if ...]> tag,
but when doing complex operations, use of embedded Perl/ASP should be
strongly considered. Most of the tests use Perl code, but Interchange
uses the Safe.pm module with its default restrictions to help ensure
that improper code will not crash the server or modify the wrong data.

Perl can also be embedded within the page, and if given the proper
permission by the system administrator, can call upon resources from
other computers and networks.

=head1 Variable Replacement

Variable substitution is a simple and oft-used feature of Interchange
templates. Before anything else is done on a template, all variable
tokens are replaced by variable values. There are three types of
variable tokens:

C<__VARIABLENAME__> is replaced by the catalog variable called
VARIABLENAME.

C<@@VARIABLENAME@@> is replaced by the global variable called
VARIABLENAME.

C<@_VARIABLENAME_@> is replaced by the catalog variable VARIABLENAME
if it exists; otherwise, it is replaced by the global variable
VARIABLENAME.

See the C<icconfig> documentation for information on how to use the
C<Variable> configuration file directive to set global variables in
C<interchange.cfg> and catalog variables in C<catalog.cfg>.

=head2 Tag Syntax

Interchange uses a style similar to HTML, but with [square brackets]
replacing <chevrons>. The parameters that can be passed are much the
same, where a parameter="parameter value" can be passed.

Summary:

   [tag parameter]             Tag called with positional parameter
   [tag parameter=value]       Tag called with named parameter
   [tag parameter="the value"] Tag called with space in parameter
   [tag 1 2 3]                 Tag called with multiple positional parameters
   [tag foo=1 bar=2 baz=3]     Tag called with multiple named parameters
   [tag foo=`2 + 2`]           Tag called with calculated parameter
   [tag foo="[value bar]"]     Tag called with tag inside parameter
   [tag foo="[value bar]"]
       Container text.         Container tag.
   [/tag]

Most tags can accept some positional parameters. This speeds up
parsing and is simpler to write in many cases.

Here is an example tag:

   [value name=city]

This will cause Interchange to look in the user form value array and
return the value of the form parameter C<city>, which might have been
set with:

   City: <INPUT TYPE=text NAME=city VALUE="[value city]">

Note that the value was pre-set with the previous value of C<city> (if
any). It uses the positional style -- C<name> is the first positional
parameter for the [value ...] tag. Positional parameters cannot be
derived from other Interchange tags; for instance [value [value
formfield]] will not work. But if the named parameter syntax is used,
the parameters can contain other tags, such as:

   [value name="[value formfield]"]

There is one exception to the above rule when using the [item-list],
[loop ...], [sql ...], and other list tags. These will be examined in
following sections.

Many Interchange tags are container tags:

   [set Checkout]
       mv_nextpage=ord/checkout
       mv_todo=return
   [/set]

Tags and parameter names are not case sensitive, so [VALUE
NAME=something] would work just as well. Interchange convention is to
place HTML tags in upper case and Interchange tags in lower case so
pages are easier to read, but this sense can easily be reversed.

Single quotes work just as well as double quotes, and can prevent
ambiguity.

   [value name=b_city set='[value city]']

Backticks, the other single quote, cause the parameter contents to be
evaluated as Perl code via the C<[calc]> tag. (This is in MV3.15 and
above.) For example:

   [value name=row_value set=`$row_value += 1`]

is the same as

   [value name=row_value set="[calc]$row_value += 1[/calc]"]

Pipes are also quoting characters, but have the special behavior of
stripping leading and trailing whitespace. For example:

       [loop list="code        field    field2  field3
       k1    A1    A2    A3
       k2      B1      B2      B3"]
       [loop-increment][loop-code]
       [/loop]

might be more elegantly expressed as:

    [loop list=|
            k1    A1    A2    A3
            k2    B1    B2    B3"]
    |]
        [loop-increment][loop-code]
    [/loop]

What is done with the results of the tag depends on whether it is a
container or standalone tag. A container tag is one which has an end
tag, i.e., C<[tag] stuff [/tag]>. A standalone tag has no end tag, as
in C<[area href=somepage]>.  (Note that C<[page ...]> and C<[order
..]> are B<not> container tags.)

A container tag will have its output re-parsed for more Interchange
tags by default. To inhibit this behavior, explicitly set the
attribute reparse to 0.  Note that the default action is almost always
desirable. With some exceptions (C<[include file]> among them), the
output of a standalone tag will not be re-interpreted for Interchange
tag constructs.

Most container tags will not have their contents interpreted before
being passed the container text. Exceptions include C<[calc]> ..
C<[/calc]> and C<[currency]> ... C<[/currency]>. All tags accept the
INTERPOLATE=1 tag modifier, which causes the interpretation to take
place. It is not necessary to interpret the contents of a C<[set
variable]> TAGS C<[/set]> pair, as they might contain tags which
should only be upon evaluating an order profile, search profile, or
C<mv_click> operation. If the evaluation is performed at the time a
variable is set, use C<[set name=variable interpolate=1] TAGS [/set]>.

=head2 DATA and FIELD

The C<[data ...]> and C<[field ...]> tags access elements of
Interchange databases. They are the form used outside of the iterating
lists, and can be effectively used to do lookups when the table,
column/field or key/row is conditional based on a previous operation.

The following are equivalent for attribute names:

   table ---> base
   col   ---> field --> column
   key   ---> code  --> row

The [field ...] tag is special in that it looks in any of the tables
defined as C<ProductFiles>, in that order, for the data, returning the
first non-empty value. In most catalogs, where C<ProductFiles> is not
defined, i.e., the demo, C<[field title 00-0011]> is equivalent to
C<[data products title 00-0011]>. For example, [field col=foo key=bar]
will not display something from the table "category" because
"category" is not in the directive ProductFiles or there are multiple
ProductFiles and an earlier one has an entry for that key.

=over 4

=item [data table column key]

named attributes: C<[data base="database" field="field" key="key">
C<value="value" op="increment]>

Returns the value of the field in any of the arbitrary databases, or
from the variable namespaces. If the option C<increment=1> is present,
the field will be automatically incremented with the value in value.

If a DBM-based database is to be modified, it must be flagged writable
on the page calling the write tag. For example, use C<[tag flag
write]products[/tag]> to mark the C<products> database writable.

In addition, the C<[data ...]> tag can access a number of elements in
the Interchange session database:

    accesses      Accesses within the last 30 s    arg           The argument passed in a [page ...] or [area ...] tag
    browser       The user browser string
    host          Interchange's idea of the host (modified by DomainTail)
    last_error    The last error from the error logging
    last_url      The current Interchange path_info
    logged_in     Whether the user is logged in via UserDB
    pageCount     Number of unique URLs generated
    prev_url      The previous path_info
    referer       HTTP_REFERER string
    ship_message  The last error messages from shipping
    source        Source of original entry to Interchange
    time          Time (seconds since Jan 1, 1970) of last access
    user          The REMOTE_USER string
    username      User name logged in as (UserDB)

conds

Databases will hide variables, so if a database is named "session,"
"scratch," or any of the other reserved names, it won't be able to use
the C<[data ...]> tag to read them. Case is sensitive, so in a pinch
the database could be called "Session," but this is not good practice.

=item [field name code]

named attributes: C<[field code="code" name="fieldname"]>

Expands into the value of the field name for the product identified by
code as found by searching the products database. It will return the
first entry found in the series of Product Files in the products
database. If this needs to constrained to a particular table, use a
C<[data table col key]> call.

=back

=head2 set, seti, scratch and scratchd

Scratch variables are maintained in the user session separate from the
form variable values set on HTML forms. Many things can be controlled
with scratch variables, particularly search and order processing, the
C<mv_click> multiple variable setting facility, and key Interchange
conditions session URL display.

There are three tags which are used to set the space, C<[set
name]value[/set]>, [seti name]value[/seti], [tmp name]value[/tmp], and
two variations (or shortcuts).

=over 4

=item [set variable]value[/set]

named attributes: C<[set name="variable"] value [/set]>

Sets a scratchpad variable to value.

Most of the mv_* variables that are used for search and order
conditionals are in another namespace. They can be set by means of
hidden fields in a form.

An order profile would be set with:

  [set che  name=required You must give us your name.
  address=required Oops! No address.
  [/set]
  <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=mv_order_profile VALUE="checkout">

kout]

A search profile would be set with:

  [set substring  mv_substring_match=yes
  mv_case=yes
  [/set]
  <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=mv_profile VALUE="substring_case">

case]

To do the same as C<[set foo]bar[/set]> in embedded Perl:

    [calc]$Scratch->{foo} = 'bar'; return;[/calc]

=item [seti variable][value something][/seti]

Same as C<[set] [/set]>, except it interpolates the container text.
The above is the same as:

    [set name=variable interpolate=1][value something][/set]

=item [tmp name]value[/tmp]

Same as [seti] but does not persist.

=item [scratch name]

Returns the contents of a scratch variable to the page. C<[scratch
foo]> is the same as, but faster than:

    [perl]$Scratch->{foo}[/perl]

=item [scratchd]

Same as [scratch name], except deletes the value. Same as [scratch
foo][set foo][/set].

=item [if scratch name op* compare*] yes [else] no [/else] [/if]

Tests a scratch variable. See IF.

=back

=head2 loop

Loop lists can be used to construct arbitrary lists based on the
contents of a database field, a search, or other value (like a fixed
list). Loop accepts a C<search> parameter which will do one-click
searches on a database table (or file).

To iterate over all keys in a table, use the idiom (C<[loop
search="ra=yes/ml=9999"] [/loop]>. C<ra=yes> sets C<mv_return_all>,
which means "match everything". The C<ml=9999> limits matches to that
many records. Normally this many matches will not be necessary, but it
is a reasonable default maximum. If the text file for searching an
Interchange DBM database is not used, set C<st=db> (mv_searchtype).

When using C<st=db>, returned keys may be affected by
C<TableRestrict>. See C<catalog.cfg>. Both can be sorted with C<[sort
table:field:mod -start +number]> modifiers. See C<Sorting>.

=over 4

=item [loop item item item] LIST [/loop]

named attributes: C<[loop prefix=label* list="item item item"*
search="se=whatever"*]>

Returns a string consisting of the LIST, repeated for every item in a
comma-separated or space-separated list. Operates in the same fashion
as the C<[item-list]> tag, except for order-item-specific values.
Intended to pull multiple attributes from an item modifier, but can be
useful for other things, like building a pre-ordained product list on
a page.

Loop lists can be nested by using different prefixes:

    [loop prefix=size list="Small Medium L        [loop prefix=color list="Red White Blue"]
            [color-code]-[size-code]<BR>
        [/loop]
        <P>
    [/loop]

rge"]

This will output:

                Red                White-Small
                Blue-Small

                Red-Medium
                White-Medium
                Blue-Medium

                Red-Large
                White-Large
                Blue-Large

Small

The search="args" parameter will return an arbitrary search, just as
in a one-click search:

    [loop search="se=Americana/sf=cate        [loop-code] [loop-field title]
    [/loop]

ory"]

The above will show all items with a category containing the whole
world "Americana."

=item [if-loop-data table field] IF [else] ELSE [/else][/if-loop-field]

Outputs the IF if the C<field> in C<table> is non-empty, and the ELSE
(if any) otherwise.

=back

B<Note: >This tag does not nest with other C<[if-loop-data ...]> tags.

=over 4

=item [if-loop-field field] IF [else] ELSE [/else][/if-loop-field]

Outputs the IF if the C<field> in the C<products> table is non-empty,
and the ELSE (if any) otherwise.

=back

B<Note: >This tag does not nest with other C<[if-loop-field ...]>
tags.

=over 4

=item [loop-alternate N] DIVISIBLE [else] NOT DIVISIBLE [/else][/loop-alternate]

Set up an alternation sequence. If the loop-increment is divisible by
C<N>, the text will be displayed. If an C<[else]NOT DIVISIBLE TEXT
[/else]> is present, then the NOT DIVISIBLE TEXT will be displayed.
For example:

    [loop-alternate 2]EVEN[else]ODD[/else][/loop-alte    [loop-alternate 3]BY 3[else]NOT by 3[/else][/loop-alternate]

nate]

=item [/loop-alternate]

Terminates the alternation area.

=item [loop-change marker]

Same as C<[item-change]>, but within loop lists.

=item [loop-code]

Evaluates to the first returned parameter for the current returned
record.

=item [loop-data database fieldname]

Evaluates to the field name fieldname in the arbitrary database table
database for the current item.

=item [loop-description]

Evaluates to the product description for the current item. Returns the
<Description Field> from the first products database where that item
exists.

=item [loop-field fieldname]

The [loop-field ...] tag is special in that it looks in any of the
tables defined as C<ProductFiles>, in that order, for the data,
returning the value only if that key is defined. In most catalogs,
where C<ProductFiles> is not defined (i.e., the demo), C<[loop-field
title]> is equivalent to C<[loop-data products title]>.

Evaluates to the field name fieldname in the database for the current
item.

=item [loop-increment]

Evaluates to the number of the item in the list. Used for numbering
items in the list. Starts from one (1).

=item [loop-last]tags[/loop-last]

Evaluates the output of the ITL tags encased inside. If it evaluates
to a numerical non-zero number (i.e., 1, 23, or -1), the loop
iteration will terminate. If the evaluated number is negative, the
item itself will be skipped. If the evaluated number is positive, the
item itself will be shown, but will be last on the list.

      [loop-last]        return -1 if '[loop-field weight]' eq '';
        return 1 if '[loop-field weight]' < 1;
        return 0;
        [/calc][/loop-last]

calc]

If this is contained in your C<[loop list]> and the weight field is
empty, a numerical C<-1> will be output from the C<[calc][/calc]>
tags; the list will end and the item will B<not> be shown. If the
product's weight field is less than 1, a numerical 1 is output. The
item will be shown, but it will be the last item shown.

=item [loop-next]tags[/loop-next]

Evaluates the output of the ITL tags encased inside. If it evaluates
to a numerical non-zero number (i.e., 1, 23, or -1), the loop will be
skipped with no output. Example:

      [loop-next][calc][loop-field weight] < 1[/calc][/loop-next]

If this is contained in your C<[loop list]> and the product's weight
field is less than 1, a numerical C<1> will be output from the
C<[calc][/calc]> operation. The item will not be shown.

=item [loop-price n* noformat*]

Evaluates to the price for optional quantity n (from the products
file) of the current item, with currency formatting. If the optional
"noformat" is set, then currency formatting will not be applied.

=item [loop-calc]PERL[/loop-calc]

Calls embedded Perl with the code in the container. All [loop-...]
tags can be placed inside except for [loop-filter ...][/loop-filter],
[loop-exec routine][/loop-exec], [loop-last][/loop-last], and
[loop-next][/loop-next.

=back

B<Note: >All normal embedded Perl operations can be used, but be
careful to pre-open any database tables with a [perl tables="tables
you need"][/perl] tag prior to the opening of the [loop].

=over 4

=item [loop-exec routine]argument[/loop-exec]

Calls a subroutine predefined either in catalog.cfg with Sub, or in a
[loop...] with [loop-sub routine]PERL[/loop-sub]. The container text
is passed as $_[0], and the array (or hash) value of the current row
is $_[1].

=item [loop-sub routine]PERL[/loop-sub]

Defines a subroutine that is available to the current (and subsequent)
[loop-...] tags within the same page. See Interchange Programming.

Allows conditional building of HTML based on the setting of various
Interchange session and database values. The general form is:

    [if type term op co    [then]
                                If true, this is printed on the document.
                                The [then] [/then] is optional in most
                                cases. If ! is prepended to the type
                                setting, the sense is reversed and
                                this will be output for a false condition.
    [/then]
    [elsif type term op compare]
                                Optional, tested when if fails.
    [/elsif]
    [else]
                                Optional, printed when all above fail.
    [/else]
    [/if]

The C<[if]> tag can also have some variants:

    [if explicit][condition] CODE [/cond                Displayed if valid Perl CODE returns a true value.
    [/if]

tion]

Some Perl-style regular expressions can be written, and combine
conditions:

    [if value name =~ /^m                                This is the if with Mike.
    [elsif value name =~ /^sally/i]
                                This is an elsif with Sally.
    [/elsif]
    [elsif value name =~ /^barb/i]
    [or value name =~ /^mary/i]
                                This is an elsif with Barb or Mary.
    [elsif value name =~ /^pat/i]
    [and value othername =~ /^mike/i]
                                This is an elsif with Pat and Mike.
    [/elsif]
    [else]
                                This is the else, no name I know.
    [/else]
    [/if]

ke/i]

While the named parameter tag syntax works for C<[if ...]>, it is more
convenient to use the positional syntax in most cases. The only
exception is when planning on doing a test on the results of another
tag sequence:

This will not work:

   [if value name =~ /[value b_name]/]
       Shipping name matches billing name.
   [/if]

This will not work. Do this instead:

   [if type=value term=name op="=~" compare="/[value b_name]/"]
       Shipping name matches billing name.
   [/if]

As an alternative:

   [if type=value term=high_water op="<" compare="[shipping noformat=1]"]
       Shipping cost is too high, charter a truck.
   [/if]

There are many test targets available:

=over 4

=item config Directive

The Interchange configuration variables. These are set by the
directives in the Interchange configuration file (or the defaults).

    [if config CreditCar    Auto credit card validation is enabled.
    [/if]

Auto]

=item data  database::field::key

The Interchange databases. Retrieves a field in the database and
returns true or false based on the value.

    [if data products::size::9    There is size information.
    [else]
    No size information.
    [/else]
    [/if]

    [if data products::size::99-102 =~ /small/i]
    There is a small size available.
    [else]
    No small size available.
    [/else]
    [/if]

-102]

If another tag is needed to select the key, and it is not a looping
tag construct, named parameters must be used:

    [set code]99-102    [if type=data term="products::size::[scratch code]"]
    There is size information.
    [else]
    No size information.
    [/else]
    [/if]

/set]

=item discount

Checks to see if a discount is present for an item.

    [if discount 9    Item is discounted.
    [/if]

-102]

=item explicit

A test for an explicit value. If Perl code is placed between a
C<[condition]> C<[/condition]> tag pair, it will be used to make the
comparison. Arguments can be passed to import data from user space,
just as with the C<[perl]> tag.

    [if exp    [condition]
        $country = $ values =~{country};
        return 1 if $country =~ /u\.?s\.?a?/i;
        return 0;
    [/condition]
    You have indicated a US address.
    [else]
    You have indicated a non-US address.
    [/else]
    [/if]

icit]

This example is a bit contrived, as the same thing could be
accomplished with C<[if value country =~ /u\.?s\.?a?/i]>, but there
are many situations where it is useful.

=item file

Tests for existence of a file. Useful for placing image tags only if
the image is present.

    [if file /home/user/www/images/[item-code    <IMG SRC="[item-code].gif">
    [/if]

    or

    [if type=file term="/home/user/www/images/[item-code].gif"]
    <IMG SRC="[item-code].gif">
    [/if]

.gif]

The C<file> test requires that the SafeUntrap directive contains
C<ftfile> (which is the default).

=item items

The Interchange shopping carts. If not specified, the cart used is the
main cart. Usually used as a litmus test to see if anything is in the
cart. For example:

  [if items]You have items in your shopping cart
  [if items layaway]You have items on layaway.[/if]

[/if]

=item ordered

Order status of individual items in the Interchange shopping carts. If
not specified, the cart used is the main cart. The following items
refer to a part number of 99-102.

  [if ordered 99-102] ...    Checks the status of an item on order, true if item
    99-102 is in the main cart.

  [if ordered 99-102 layaway] ... [/if]
    Checks the status of an item on order, true if item
    99-102 is in the layaway cart.

  [if ordered 99-102 main size] ... [/if]
    Checks the status of an item on order in the main cart,
    true if it has a size attribute.

  [if ordered 99-102 main size =~ /large/i] ... [/if]
    Checks the status of an item on order in the main cart,
    true if it has a size attribute containing 'large'.
    THE CART NAME IS REQUIRED IN THE OLD SYNTAX. The new
    syntax for that one would be:

    [if type=ordered term="99-102" compare="size =~ /large/i"]

    To make sure it is exactly large, you could use:

    [if ordered 99-102 main size eq 'large'] ... [/if]

  [if ordered 99-102 main lines] ... [/if]
      Special case -- counts the lines that the item code is
      present on. (Only useful, of course, when mv_separate_items
      or SeparateItems is defined.)

[/if]

=item scratch

The Interchange scratchpad variables, which can be set with the C<[set
name]value[/set]> element.

    [if scratch mv_separate_    Ordered items will be placed on a separate line.
    [else]
    Ordered items will be placed on the same line.
    [/else]
    [/if]

tems]

=item session

The Interchange session variables. Of particular interest are
logged_in, source, browser, and username.

=item validcc

A special case, takes the form C<[if validcc no type exp_date]>.
Evaluates to true if the supplied credit card number, type of card,
and expiration date pass a validity test. Does a LUHN-10 calculation
to weed out typos or phony card numbers.

=item value

The Interchange user variables, typically set in search, control, or
order forms. Variables beginning with C<mv_> are Interchange special
values, and should be tested/used with caution.

=item variable

See Interchange I<Variable> values.

=back

The field term is the specifier for that area. For example, C<[if
session frames]> would return true if the C<frames> session parameter
was set.

As an example, consider buttonbars for frame-based setups. It would be
nice to display a different buttonbar (with no frame targets) for
sessions that are not using frames:

   [if session frames]
       [buttonbar 1]
   [else]
       [buttonbar 2]
   [/else]
   [/if]

Another example might be the when search matches are displayed. If
using the string C<[value mv_match_count] titles found>, it will
display a plural for only one match. Use:

   [if value mv_match_count != 1]
       [value mv_match_count] matches found.
   [else]
       Only one match was found.
   [/else]
   [/if]

The op term is the compare operation to be used. Compare operations
are as in Perl:

   ==  numeric equivalence
   eq  string equivalence
   >   numeric greater-than
   gt  string greater-than
   <   numeric less-than
   lt  string less-than
   !=  numeric non-equivalence
   ne  string equivalence

Any simple Perl test can be used, including some limited regex
matching. More complex tests are best done with C<[if explicit]>.

=over 4

=item [then] text [/then]

This is optional if not nesting if conditions. The text immediately
following the C<[if ..]> tag is used as the conditionally substituted
text. If nesting C<[if ...]> tags, use a C<[then][/then]> on any
outside conditions to ensure proper interpolation.

=item [elsif type field op* compare*]

named attributes: C<[elsif type="type" term="field" op="op"
compare="compare"]>

Additional conditions for test, applied if the initial C<[if ..]> test
fails.

=item [else] text [/else]

The optional else-text for an if or if-item-field conditional.

=item [condition] text [/condition]

Only used with the C<[if explicit]> tag. Allows an arbitrary
expression B<in Perl> to be placed inside, with its return value
interpreted as the result of the test. If arguments are added to C<[if
explicit args]>, those will be passed as arguments are in the
C<[perl]> construct.

=item [/if]

Terminates an if conditional.

=head1 Programming

Interchange has a powerful paradigm for extending and enhancing its
functionality.  It uses two mechanisms, C<user-defined tags> and
C<user subroutines> on two different security levels, global and
catalog. In addition, C<Embedded Perl Code> may be used to build
functionality into a site's page.

C<User-defined tags> are defined with the UserTag directive in either
C<minivend.cfg> or C<catalog.cfg>. The ones in C<minivend.cfg> are
global, i.e., they are not constrained by the C<Safe> Perl module as
to which opcodes and  routines they may use. Normally, the
user-defined tags in  C<catalog.cfg> are constrained by C<Safe>, but
if the C<AllowGlobal> global directive is set for the particular
catalog in use, its C<UserTag> and C<Sub> definitions will have global
capability.

Many of the internal Interchange routines can be accessed by the savvy
programmer who reads the source and finds the entry points. Also, many
internal Interchange routines can be overridden:

    GlobalSub <<EOS
    sub just_for_overriding {
        package Vend::Module;
        use MyModule;
        sub to_override {
            &MyModule::do_something_funky($Values->{my_variable});
        }
    }
    EOS

The effect of the above is to override the C<to_override> routine in
the module C<Vend::Module>. This is preferable to hacking on the code
if the functionality change is expected to last long. Then, the
Interchange code can be updated, in most cases, while still keeping
your hack.

=head2 Embedded Perl Code

Perl code can be directly embedded in Interchange pages. The code is
specified as:

    [perl]
        $name    = $Values->{name};
        $browser = $Session->{browser};
        return "Hi, $name! How do you like your $browser?";
    [/perl]

ASP syntax can be used with:

    [mvasp]
        <%
        $name    = $Values->{name};
        $browser = $Session->{browser};
        %>
        Hi, <%= $name %>!
        <%
            HTML "How do you like your $browser?";
        %>
    [/mvasp]

The two snippets above are essentially equivalent.

table

Description:

Import one or more records into a database. The type is any of the
valid Interchange delimiter types, with the default being defined by
the setting of the database DELIMITER. The table must already be a
defined Interchange database table; it cannot be created on-the-fly.
(Use SQL for on-the-fly tables.)

The type of LINE and continue setting of NOTES is particularly useful,
for it allows the naming of fields so that the order in which they
appear in the database will not have to be remembered. The following
two imports are identical in effect:

    [import table=o    code: [value mv_order_number]
    shipping_mode: [shipping-description]
    status: pending
    [/import]

    [import table=orders]
    shipping_mode: [shipping-description]
    status: pending
    code: [value mv_order_number]
    [/import]

ders]

The code or key must always be present, and is always named code. If
NOTES mode is not used, import the fields in the same order as they
appear in the ASCII source file. The [import ....] TEXT [/import]
region may contain multiple records. If using NOTES mode, use a
separator, which by default is a form-feed character (^L).

=item [price code quantity* database* noformat*]

named attributes: C<[price code="code" quantity="N" base="database"
noformat=1* optionX="value"]>

Expands into the price of the product identified by code as found in
the products database. If there is more than one products file
defined, they will be searched in order unless constrained by the
optional argument base. The optional argument quantity selects an
entry from the quantity price list. To receive a raw number, with no
currency formatting, use the option C<noformat=1>.

If an named attribute corresponding to a product option is passed, and
that option would cause a change in the price, the appropriate price
will be displayed.

Demo example: The T-Shirt (product code 99-102), with a base price of
$10.00, can vary in price depending on size and color. C<S>, the small
size, is 50 cents less; C<XL>, the extra large size, is $1.00 more,
and the color C<RED> is 0.75 extra. There are also quantity pricing
breaks (see the demo C<pricing> database. So the following will be
true:

    [price  code=            size=L]              is $10.00

    [price  code=99-102
            size=XL]             is $11.00

    [price  code=99-102
            color=RED
            size=XL]             is $11.75

    [price  code=99-102
            size=XL
            quantity=10]         is $10.00

    [price  code=99-102
            size=S]              is $9.50

9-102

An illustration of this is on the simple C<flypage> template when
passed that item code.

=item [description code table*]

named attributes: C<[description code="code" base="database"]>

Expands into the description of the product identified by code as
found in the products database. If there is more than one products
file defined, they will be searched in order unless constrained by the
optional argument table.

=item [accessories code attribute*, type*, field*, database*, name*, outboard*]

named attributes: C<[accessories code="code"> C<arg="attribute*,
type*, field*, database*, name*, outboard*"]>

Initiates special processing of item attributes based on entries in
the product database. See Item Attributes for a complete description
of the arguments.

When called with an attribute, the database is consulted and looks for
a comma-separated list of attribute options. They take the form:

    name=Label Text, name=Label Text*

The label text is optional. If none is given, the B<name> will be
used.

If an asterisk is the last character of the label text, the item is
the default selection. If no default is specified, the first will be
the default. An example:

    [accessories TK112 color]

This will search the product database for a field named "color." If an
entry "beige=Almond, gold=Harvest Gold, White*, green=Avocado" is
found, a select box like this will be built:

    <SELECT NAME="mv_order_c    <OPTION VALUE="beige">Almond
    <OPTION VALUE="gold">Harvest Gold
    <OPTION SELECTED>White
    <OPTION VALUE="green">Avocado
    </SELECT>

lor">

In combination with the C<mv_order_item> and C<mv_order_quantity>
variables, this can be used to allow entry of an attribute at time of
order.

=back

=head2 FILE and INCLUDE

These elements read a file from the disk and insert the contents in
the location of the tag. C<[include ...]> will allow insertion of
Interchange variables and ITL tags.

=over 4

=item [file ...]

named: [file name="name" type="dos|mac|unix"*]

positional: [file name]

Inserts the contents of the named file. The file should normally be
relative to the catalog directory. File names beginning with / or ..
are only allowed if the Interchange server administrator has disabled
NoAbsolute. The optional C<type> parameter will do an appropriate
ASCII translation on the file before it is sent.

=item [include file]

named attributes: C<[include file="name"]>

Same as C<[file name]> except interpolates for all Interchange tags
and variables.

=back

=head2 Banner/Ad rotation

Interchange has a built-in banner rotation system designed to show ads
or other messages according to category and an optional weighting.

The C<[banner ...]> ITL tag is used to implement it.

The weighting system pre-builds banners in the directory 'Banners,'
under the temporary directory. It will build one copy of the banner
for every one weight. If one banner is weighted C<7>, one C<2>, and
one C<1>, then a total of 10 pre-built banners will be made. The first
will be displayed 70 percent of the time, the second 20 percent, and
the third 10 percent, in random fashion. If all banners need to be
equal, give each a weight of 1.

Each category may have separate weighting. If the above is placed in
category C<tech>, then it will behave as above when placed in
C<[banner category=tech]> in the page. A separate category, say
C<art>, would have its own rotation and weighting.

The C<[banner ...]> tag is based on a database table, named C<banners>
by default. It expects a total of five (5) fields in the table:

=over 4

=item code

This is the key for the item. If the banners are not weighted, this
should be a category specific code.

=item category

To choose to categorize weighted ads, this contains the category to
select. If empty, it will be placed in the default (or blank)
category.

=item weight

Must be an integer number 1 or greater to include this ad in the
weighting. If 0 or blank, the ad will be ignored when weighted ads are
built.

=item rotate

If the weighted banners are not used, this must contain some value. If
the field is empty, the banner will not be displayed. If the value is
specifically C<0> (zero), then the entire contents of the C<banner>
field will be displayed when this category is used. If it is non-zero,
then the contents of the C<banner> field will be split into segments
(by the separator C<{or}>). For each segment, the banners will rotate
in sequence for that user only. Obviously, the first banner in the
sequence is more likely to be displayed than the last.

Summary of values of rotate field:

    non-zero, non-blank: Rotati    blank:               Ad not displayed
    0:                   Ad is entire contents of banner field

g ads

=item banner

This contains the banner text. If more than one banner is in the
field, they should be separated by the text C<{or}> (which will not be
displayed).

=back

Interchange expects the C<banner> field to contains the banner text.
It can contain more than one banner, separated by the string '{or}.'
To activate the ad, place any string in the field C<rotate>.

The special key "default" is the banner that is displayed if no
banners are found. (Doesn't apply to weighted banners.)

Weighted banners are built the first time they are accessed after
catalog reconfiguration. They will not be rebuilt until the catalog is
reconfigured, or the file tmp/Banners/total_weight and
tmp/Banners/<category>/total_weight is removed.

If the option C<once> is passed (i.e., [banner once=1 weighted=1],
then the banners will not be rebuilt until the C<total_weight> file is
removed.

The database specification should make the C<weight> field numeric so
that the proper query can be made. Here is the example from
Interchange's demo:

   Database   banner   banner.txt   TAB
   Database   banner   NUMERIC      weight

Examples:

=over 4

=item weighted, categorized

To select categorized and weighted banners:

The C<banner> table would look like this:

    code    category   weight   rotate       t1      tech       1                 Click here for a 10% banner
    t2      tech       2                 Click here for a 20% banner
    t3      tech       7                 Click here for a 70% banner
    a1      art        1                 Click here for a 10% banner
    a2      art        2                 Click here for a 20% banner
    a3      art        7                 Click here for a 70% banner

anner

Tag would be:

    [banner weighted=1 category="tech"]

This will find *all* banners with a weight >= 1 where the C<category>
field is equal to C<tech>. The files will be made into the director
C<tmp/Banners/tech>.

=item weighted

To select weighted banners:

    [banner weighted=1]

This will find *all* banners with a weight >= 1. (Remember, integers
only.) The files will be made into the director C<tmp/Banners>.

    code    category   weight   rotate       t1      tech       1                 Tech banner 1
    t2      tech       2                 Tech banner 2
    t3      tech       7                 Tech banner 3
    a1      art        1                 Art banner 1
    a2      art        2                 Art banner 2
    a3      art        7                 Art banner 3

anner

Each of the above with a weight of 7 will actually be displayed 35
percent of the time.

=item categorized, not rotating

    [banner category="tech"]

This is equivalent to:

    [data table=banner col=banner key=tech

The differences are that it is not selected if "rotate" field is
blank; if not selected, the default banner is displayed.

The C<banner> table would look like this:

    code    category   weight   rotate       tech               0        0        Tech banner

anner

Interchange tags can be inserted in the category parameter, if
desired:

    [banner category="[value interest]"]

=item categorized and rotating

    [banner category="tech"]

The difference between this and above is the database.

The C<banner> table would look like this:

    code    category   weight   rotate       tech               0        1        Tech banner 1{or}Tech banner 2
    art                0        1        Art banner 1{or}Art banner 2

anner

This would rotate between banner 1 and 2 for the category tech for
each user. Banner 1 is always displayed first. The C<art> banner would
never be displayed unless the tag C<[banner category=art]> was used,
of course.

Interchange tags can be inserted in the category parameter, if
desired:

    [banner category="[value interest]"]

=item multi-level categorized

    [banner category="tech:hw"] or [banner category="tech:sw"]

If have a colon-separated category, Interchange will select the most
specific ad available. If the C<banner> table looks like this:

    code    category   weight   rotate       tech               0        1        Tech banner 1{or}Tech banner 2
    tech:hw            0        1        Hardware banner 1{or}HW banner 2
    tech:sw            0        1        Software banner 1{or}SW banner 2

anner

This works the same as single-level categories, except that the
category tech:hw will select that banner. The category tech:sw will
select its own. But, the category tech:html would just get the "tech"
banner. Otherwise, it works just as in other categorized ads. Rotation
will work if set non-zero/non-blank, and it will be inactive if the
rotate field is blank. Each category rotates on its own.

=head2 Tags for Summarizing Shopping Basket/Cart

The following elements are used to access common items which need to
be displayed on baskets and checkout pages.

B<* marks an optional parameter>

=over 4

=item [item-list cart*]

named attributes: C<[item-list name="cart"]>

Places an iterative list of the items in the specified shopping cart,
the main cart by default. See Item Lists for a description.

=item [/item-list]

Terminates the C<[item-list]> tag.

=item [nitems cart*]

Expands into the total number of items ordered so far. Takes an
optional cart name as a parameter.

=item [subtotal]

Expands into the subtotal cost, exclusive of sales tax, of all the
items ordered so far.

=item [salestax cart*]

Expands into the sales tax on the subtotal of all the items ordered so
far. If there is no key field to derive the proper percentage, such as
state or zip code, it is set to 0. See SALES TAX for more information.

=item [shipping-description mode*]

named attributes: C<[shipping-description name="mode"]>

The text description of mode. The default is the shipping mode
currently selected.

=item [shipping mode*]

named attributes: C<[shipping name="mode"]>

The shipping cost of the items in the basket via C<mode>. The default
mode is the shipping mode currently selected in the C<mv_shipmode>
variable. See SHIPPING.

=item [total-cost cart*]

Expands into the total cost of all the items in the current shopping
cart, including sales tax, if any.

=item [currency convert*]

named attributes: C<[currency convert=1*]>

When passed a value of a single number, formats it according to the
currency specification. For instance:

    [currency]4[/currency]

will display:

    4.00

Uses the Locale and PriceCommas settings as appropriate, and can
contain a C<[calc]> region. If the optional "convert" parameter is
set, it will convert according to PriceDivide> for the current locale.
If Locale is set to C<fr_FR>, and F<PriceDivide> for C<fr_FR> is
0.167, using the following sequence:

    [currency convert=1] [calc] 500.00 + 1000.00 [/calc] [/currency]

will cause the number 8.982,04 to be displayed.

=item [/currency]

Terminates the currency region.

=item [cart name]

named attributes: C<[cart name="name"]>

Sets the name of the current shopping cart for display of shipping,
price, total, subtotal, and nitems tags. If a different price is used
for the cart, all of the above except C<[shipping]> will reflect the
normal price field. Those operations must be emulated with embedded
Perl or the C<[item-list]>, C<[calc]>, and C<[currency]> tags, or use
the PriceAdjustment feature to set it.

=item [row nn]

named attributes: C<[row width="nn"]>

Formats text in tables. Intended for use in emailed reports or
<PRE></PRE> HTML areas. The parameter nn gives the number of columns
to use. Inside the row tag, C<[col param=value ...]> tags may be used.

=item [/row]

Terminates a C<[row nn]> element.

=item [col width=nn wrap=yes|no gutter=n align=left|right|input spacing=n]

Sets up a column for use in a C<[row]>. This parameter can only be
contained inside a C<[row nn] [/row]> tag pair. Any number of columns
(that fit within the size of the row) can be defined.

The parameters are:

    width=nn        The column width, including the gutter. M                    supplied, there is no default. A shorthand method
                    is to just supply the number as the first parameter,
                    as in [col 20].

    gutter=n        The number of spaces used to separate the column (on
                    the right-hand side) from the next. Default is 2.

    spacing=n       The line spacing used for wrapped text. Default is 1,
                    or single-spaced.

    wrap=(yes|no)   Determines whether text that is greater in length than
                    the column width will be wrapped to the next line. Default
                    is yes.

    align=(L|R|I)   Determines whether text is aligned to the left (the default),
                    the right, or in a way that might display an HTML text
                    input field correctly.

st be

=item [/col]

Terminates the column field.

=back

=head2 Item Lists

Within any page, the C<[item-list cart*]> element shows a list of all
the items ordered by the customer so far. It works by repeating the
source between C<[item-list]> and C<[/item-list]> once for each item
ordered.

B<Note: >The special tags that reference item within the list are not
normal Interchange tags, do not take named attributes, and cannot be
contained in an HTML tag (other than to substitute for one of its
values or provide a conditional container). They are interpreted only
inside their corresponding list container. Normal Interchange tags can
be interspersed, though they will be interpreted I<after> all of the
list-specific tags.

Between the item_list markers the following elements will return
information for the current item:

=over 4

=item [if-item-data table column]

If the database field C<column> in table I<table> is non-blank, the
following text up to the C<[/if-item-data]> tag is substituted. This
can be used to substitute IMG or other tags only if the corresponding
source item is present. Also accepts a C<[else]else text[/else]> pair
for the opposite condition.

=back

B<Note: >This tag does not nest with other C<[if-item-data ...]> tags.

=over 4

=item [if-item-data table column]

Reverses sense for C<[if-item-data]>.

=item [/if-item-data]

Terminates an C<[if-item-data table column]> element.

=item [if-item-field fieldname]

If the products database field fieldname is non-blank, the following
text up to the C<[/if-item-field]> tag is substituted. If there are
more than one products database table (see ProductFiles), it will
check them in order until a matching key is found. This can be used to
substitute IMG or other tags only if the corresponding source item is
present. Also accepts a C<[else]else text[/else]> pair for the
opposite condition.

=back

B<Note: >This tag does not nest with other C<[if-item-field ...]>
tags.

=over 4

=item [if-item-field fieldname]

Reverses sense for C<[if-item-field]>.

=item [/if-item-field]

Terminates an C<[if-item-field fieldname]> element.

=item [item-accessories attribute*, type*, field*, database*, name*]

Evaluates to the value of the Accessories database entry for the item.
If passed any of the optional arguments, initiates special processing
of item attributes based on entries in the product database.

=item [item-alternate N] DIVISIBLE [else] NOT DIVISIBLE [/else][/item-alternate]

Sets up an alternation sequence. If the item-increment is divisible by
C<N>, the text will be displayed. If an C<[else]NOT DIVISIBLE
TEXT[/else]> is present, the NOT DIVISIBLE TEXT will be displayed.

For example:

    [item-alternate 2]EVEN[else]ODD[/else][/item-alte    [item-alternate 3]BY 3[else]NOT by 3[/else][/item-alternate]

nate]

=item [/item-alternate]

Terminates the alternation area.

=item [item-code]

Evaluates to the product code for the current item.

=item [item-data database fieldname]

Evaluates to the field name fieldname in the arbitrary database table
database for the current item.

=item [item-description]

Evaluates to the product description (from the products file) for the
current item.

=item [item-field fieldname]

The [item-field ...] tag is special in that it looks in any of the
tables defined as C<ProductFiles>, in that order, for the data,
returning the value only if that key is defined. In most catalogs,
where C<ProductFiles> is not defined (i.e., the demo), C<[item-field
title]> is equivalent to C<[item-data products title]>.

Evaluates to the field name fieldname in the products database for the
current item. If the item is not found in the first of the
ProductFiles, all will be searched in sequence.

=item [item-increment]

Evaluates to the number of the item in the match list. Used for
numbering search matches or order items in the list.

=item [item-last]tags[/item-last]

Evaluates the output of the Interchange tags encased inside the tags.
If it evaluates to a numerical non-zero number (i.e., 1, 23, or -1),
the list iteration will terminate. If the evaluated number is
negative, the item itself will be skipped. If the evaluated number is
positive, the item itself will be shown but will be last on the list.

      [item-last]        return -1 if '[item-field weight]' eq '';
        return 1 if '[item-field weight]' < 1;
        return 0;
        [/calc][/item-last]

calc]

If this is contained in the C<[item-list]> (or C<[search-list]> or
flypage) and the weight field is empty, a numerical C<-1> will be
output from the C<[calc][/calc]> tags; the list will end and the item
will B<not> be shown. If the product's weight field is less than 1, a
numerical 1 is output. The item will be shown, but will be the last
item shown. (If it is an C<[item-list]>, any price for the item will
still be added to the subtotal.) NOTE: there is no equivalent HTML
style.

=item [item-modifier attribute]

Evaluates to the modifier value of C<attribute> for the current item.

=item [item-next]tags[/item_next]

Evaluates the output of the Interchange tags encased inside. If it
evaluates to a numerical non-zero number (i.e., 1, 23, or -1), the
item will be skipped with no output. Example:

      [item-next][calc][item-field weight] < 1[/calc][/item-next]

If this is contained in the C<[item-list]> (or C<[search-list]> or
flypage) and the product's weight field is less than 1, a numerical
C<1> will be output from the [calc][/calc] operation. The item will
not be shown. (If it is an C<[item-list]>, any price for the item will
still be added to the subtotal.)

=item [item-price n* noformat*]

Evaluates to the price for quantity C<n> (from the products file) of
the current item, with currency formatting. If the optional "noformat"
is set, currency formatting will not be applied.

=item [discount-price n* noformat*]

Evaluates to the discount price for quantity C<n> (from the products
file) of the current item, with currency formatting. If the optional
"noformat" is set, currency formatting will not be applied. Returns
regular price if not discounted.

=item [item-discount]

Returns the difference between the regular price and the discounted
price.

=item [item-quantity]

Evaluates to the quantity ordered for the current item.

=item [item-subtotal]

Evaluates to the subtotal (quantity * price) for the current item.
Quantity price breaks are taken into account.

=item [modifier-name attribute]

Evaluates to the name to give an input box in which the customer can
specify the modifier to the ordered item.

=item [quantity-name]

Evaluates to the name to give an input box in which the customer can
enter the quantity to order.

=back

=head1 Interchange Page Display

Interchange has several methods for displaying pages:

=over 4

=item *

Display page by name

If a page with C<[page some_page]> or C<<>C<A HREF="[area
some_page]">C<>> is called and that C<some_page.html> exists in the
pages directory (C<PageDir>), it will be displayed.

=item *

On-the-fly page

If a page with C<[page 00-0011]> or C<<>C<A HREF="[area 00-0011]">C<>>
is called and C<00-0011> exists as a product in one of the products
databases (C<ProductFiles>), Interchange will use the special page
descriptor C<flypage> as a template and build based on that part
number. This is partly for convenience; the same thing can be
accomplished by calling C<[page your_template 00-0011]> and using the
C<[data session arg]> to perform the templating. But there is special
logic associated with the C<PageSelectField> configuration attribute
to allow pages to be built with varying templates.

=item *

Determine page via form action and variables

If a form action, in almost all cases the page to display will be
determined by the C<mv_nextpage> form value. Example:

    <FORM ACTION="[proc    <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=mv_todo VALUE=return>
    <SELECT NAME=mv_nextpage>
    <OPTION VALUE=index>Main page
    <OPTION VALUE=browse>Product listing
    <OPTION VALUE="ord/basket">Shopping cart
    </SELECT>
    <INPUT TYPE=submit VALUE=Go>
    </FORM>

ss]">

The C<mv_nextpage> dropdown will determine the page the user goes to.

=back

=head2 On-the-fly Catalog Pages

If an item is displayed on the search list (or order list) and there
is a link to a special page keyed on the item, Interchange will
attempt to build the page "on the fly." It will look for the special
page flypage.html, which is used as a template for building the page.
If C<[item-field fieldname]>, C<[item-price]>, and similar elements
are used on the page, complex and information-packed pages can be
built. The C<[if-item-field fieldname]> HTML C<[/if-item-field]> pair
can be used to insert HTML only if there is a non-blank value in a
particular field.

B<Important note:> Because the tags are substituted globally on the
page, C<[item-*]> tags cannot be used on the default on-the-fly page.
To use a [search-region] or [item-list] tag, change the default with
the prefix parameter. Example:

   [item-list prefix=cart]
   [cart-code] -- title=[cart-data products title]
   [/item-list]

To have an on-the-fly page mixed in reliably, use the idiom
C<[fly-list prefix=fly code="[data session arg]"]> C<[/flylist]> pair.

=over 4

=item [fly-list code="product_code" base="table"] ... [/fly-list]

Other parameters:

    prefix=label     Allows [label-code], [label-description]

Defines an area in a random page which performs the flypage lookup
function, implementing the tags below:

   [fly-list code="[data session     (contents of flypage.html)
   [/fly-list]

rg]"]

If placed around the contents of the demo flypage, in a file named
<flypage2.html>, it will make these two calls display identical pages:

    [page 00-0011] One way to display the Mona Lisa [    [page flypage2 00-0011] Another way to display the Mona Lisa [/page]

page]

=back

If the directive PageSelectField is set to a valid product database
field which contains a valid Interchange page name (relative to the
catalog pages directory, without the .html suffix), it will be used to
build the on-the-fly page.

Active tags in their order of interpolation:

 [if-item-field field]    Tests for a non-empty, non-zero value in field
[if-item-data db field]  Tests for a non-empty, non-zero field in db
[item-code]              Product code of the displayed item
[item-accessories args]  Accessory information (see accessories)
[item-description]       Description field information
[item-price quantity*]   Product price (at quantity)
[item-field field]       Product database field
[item-data db field]     Database db entry for field

=head2 Special Pages

A number of HTML pages are special for Interchange operation.
Typically, they are used to transmit error messages, status of search
or order operations, and other out of boundary conditions.

B<Note: >The distributed demo does not use all of the default values.

The names of these pages can be set with the I<SpecialPage> directive.
The standard pages and their default locations:

=over 4

=item canceled (special_pages/canceled.html)

The page displayed by Interchange when an order has been canceled by
the user.

=item catalog (special_pages/catalog.html)

The main catalog page presented by Interchange when another page is
not specified.

=item failed (special_pages/failed.html)

If the sendmail program could not be invoked to email the completed
order, the failed.html page is displayed.

=item flypage (special_pages/flypage.html)

If the catalog page for an item was not found when its C<[item-link]>
is clicked, this page is used as a template to build an on-the-fly
page. See On-the-fly Catalog Pages.

=item interact (special_pages/interact.html)

Displayed if an unexpected response was received from the browser,
such as not getting expected fields from submitting a form. This would
probably happen from typos in the html pages, but could be a browser
bug.

=item missing (special_pages/missing.html)

This page is displayed if the URL from the browser specifies a page
that does not have a matching .html file in the pages directory. This
can happen if the customer saved a bookmark to a page that was later
removed from the database, for example, or if there is a defect in the
code.

Essentially this is the same as a 404 error in HTTP. To deliberately
display a 404 error, just put this in special_pages/missing.html:

    [tag op=header]Status: 404 missing[/tag]

=item noproduct (special_pages/noproduct.html)

This page is displayed if the URL from the browser specifies the
ordering of a product code which is not in the products file.

=item order (ord/backet.htm)

This page is displayed when the customer orders an item. It can
contain any or all of the customer-entered values, but is commonly
used as a status display (or "shopping basket").

=item search (results.html)

Contains the default output page for the search engine results. Also
required is an input page, which can be the same as search.html or an
additional page. By convention Interchange defines this as the page
C<results>.

    SpecialPage   search   results

=item violation (special pages/violation.html)

Displayed if a security violation is noted, such as an attempt to
access a page denied by an C<access_gate>. See UserDB.

=back

=head2 Checking Page HTML

Interchange allows debugging of page HTML with an external page
checking program.  Because leaving this enabled on a production system
is potentially a very bad performance degradation, the program is set
in a the global configuration file with the CheckHTML directive. To
check a page for validity, set the global directive CheckHTML to the
name of the program (don't do any output redirection). A good choice
is the freely available program Weblint. It would be set in
minivend.cfg with:

   CheckHTML  /usr/local/bin/weblint -s -

Of course, the server must be restarted for it to be recognized. The
full path to the program should be used. If having trouble, check it
from the command line (as with all external programs called by
Interchange).

Insert C<[flag type=checkhtml][/tag]> at the top or bottom of pages to
check, and the output of the checker should be appended to the browser
output as a comment, visible if the page or frame source are viewed.
To do this occasionally, use a Variable setting:

   Variable  CHECK_HTML    [flag type=checkhtml]

and place __CHECK_HTML__ in the pages.  Then set the Variable to the
empty string to disable it.

=head1 Forms and Interchange

Interchange uses HTML forms for many of its functions, including
ordering, searching, updating account information, and maintaining
databases. Order operations possibly include ordering an item,
selecting item size or other attributes, and reading user information
for payment and shipment. Search operations may also be triggered by a
form.

Interchange supports file upload with the C<multipart/form-data> type.
The file is placed in memory and discarded if not accessed with the
C<[value-extended name=filevar file_contents=1]> tag or written with
C<[value-extended name=filevar outfile=your_file_name]>. See Extended
Value Access and File Upload.

=head2 Special Form Fields

Interchange treats some form fields specially, to link to the search
engine and provide more control over user presentation. It has a
number of predefined variables, most of whose names are prefixed with
C<mv_> to prevent name clashes with your variables. It also uses a few
variables which are post-fixed with integer digits; those are used to
provide control in its iterating lists.

Most of these special fields begin with C<mv_>, and include:

(O = order, S = search, C = control, A = all, X in scratch space)

 Name               scan Type  Description

mv_all_chars         ac  S   Turns on punctuation matching

=head2 Form Actions

Interchange form processing is based on an C<action> and a C<todo>.
The predefined actions at the first level are:

   process       process a todo
   search        form-based search
   scan          path-based search
   order         order an item
   minimate      get access to a database via MiniMate

Any action can be defined with C<ActionMap>.

The C<process> action has a second C<todo> level called with
C<mv_todo> or C<mv_doit>. The C<mv_todo> takes preference over
C<mv_doit>, which can be used to set a default if no C<mv_todo> is
set.

The action can be specified with any of:

=over 4

=item page name

Calling the page "search" will cause the search action. C<process>
will cause a form process action, etc. Examples:

    <FORM ACTION="/cgi-bin/simple/search" METHOD    <INPUT NAME=mv_searchspec>
    </FORM>

POST>

The above is a complete search in Interchange. It causes a simple text
search of the default products database(s). Normally hard-coded paths
are not used, but a Interchange tag can be used to specify it for
portability:

    <FORM ACTION="[area search]" METHOD    <INPUT NAME=mv_searchspec>
    </FORM>

POST>

The tag C<[process]> is often seen in Interchange forms. The above can
be called equivalently with:

    <FORM ACTION="[process]" METHOD    <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=mv_todo VALUE=search>
    <INPUT NAME=mv_searchspec>
    </FORM>

POST>

=item mv_action

Setting the special variable C<mv_action> causes the page name to be
ignored as the action source. The above forms can use this as a
synonym:

    <FORM ACTION="[area foo]" METHOD    <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=mv_action VALUE=search>
    <INPUT NAME=mv_searchspec>
    </FORM>

post>

The page name will be used to set C<mv_nextpage>, if it is not
otherwise defined. If C<mv_nextpage> is present in the form, it will
be ignored.

=back

The second level C<todo> for the C<process> action has these defined
by default:

   back         Go to mv_nextpage, don't update variables
   search   Trigger a search
   submit   Submit a form for validation (and possibly a final order)
   go       Go to mv_nextpage (same as return)
   return   Go to mv_nextpage, update variables
   set      Update a database table
   refresh  Go to mv_orderpage|mv_nextpage and check for
            ordered items
   cancel   Erase the user session

If a page name is defined as an action with C<ActionMap> or use of
Interchange's predefined action C<process>, it will cause form
processing. First level is setting the special page name C<process>,
or mv_action set to do a form C<process>, the Interchange form can be
used for any number of actions. The actions are mapped by the
ActionMap directive in the catalog configuration file, and are
selected on the form with either the mv_todo or mv_doit variables.

To set a default action for a C<process> form, set the variable
C<mv_doit> as a hidden variable:

   <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=mv_doit VALUE=refresh>

When the mv_todo value is not found, the refresh action defined in
mv_doit will be used instead.

More on the defined actions:

=over 4

=item back

Goes to the page in mv_nextpage. No user variable update.

=item cancel

All user information is erased, and the shopping cart is emptied. The
user is then sent to mv_nextpage.

=item refresh

Checks for newly-ordered items in C<mv_order_item>, looking for
on-the-fly items if that is defined, then updates the shopping cart
with any changed quantities or options. Finally updates the user
variables and returns to the page defined in mv_orderpage or
mv_nextpage (in that order of preference).

=item return

Updates the user variables and returns to the page defined in
mv_nextpage.

=item search

The shopping cart and user variables are updated, then the form
variables are interpreted and the search specification contained
therein is dispatched to the search engine. Results are returned on
the defined search page (set by mv_search_page or the search page
directives).

=item submit

Submits the form for order processing. If no order profile is defined
with the C<mv_order_profile> variable, the order is checked to see if
the current cart contains any items and the order is submitted.

If there is an order profile defined, the form will be checked against
the definition in the order profile and submitted if the pragma &final
is set to yes. If &final is set to no (the default), and the check
succeeds, the user will be routed to the Interchange page defined in
mv_successpage, or mv_nextpage. If the check fails, the user will be
routed to mv_failpage or mv_nextpage in that order.

=back

=head2 One-click Multiple Variables

Interchange can set multiple variables with a single button or form
control. First define the variable set (or profile, as in search and
order profiles) inside a scratch variable:

 [set Search by Category]
 mv_search_field=category
 mv_search_file=categories
 mv_todo=search
 [/set]

The special variable C<mv_click> sets variables just as if they were
put in on the form. It is controlled by a single button, as in:

   <INPUT TYPE=submit NAME=mv_click VALUE="Search by Category">

When the user clicks the submit button, all three variables will take
on the values defined in the "Search by Category" scratch variable.
Set the scratch variable on the same form as the button is on. This is
recommended for clarity. The C<mv_click> variable will not be carried
from form to form, it must be set on the form being submitted.

The special variable C<mv_check> sets variables for the form actions
<checkout, control, refresh, return, search,> and <submit>. This
function operates after the values are set from the form, including
the ones set by C<mv_click>, and can be used to condition input to
search routines or orders.

The variable sets can contain and be generated by most Interchange
tags. The profile is interpolated for Interchange tags before being
used. This may not always operate as expected. For instance, if the
following was set:

   [set check]
   [cgi name=mv_todo set=bar hide=1]
   mv_todo=search
   [if cgi mv_todo eq 'search']
   do something
   [/if]
   [/set]

The if condition is guaranteed to be false, because the tag
interpretation takes place before the evaluation of the variable
setting.

Any setting of variables already containing a value will overwrite the
variable. To build sets of fields (as in mv_search_field and
mv_return_fields), comma separation if that is supported for the field
must be used.

It is very convenient to use C<mv_click> as a trigger for embedded
Perl:

   <FORM ...
   <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=mv_check VALUE="Invalid Input">
   ...
   </FORM>

   [set Invalid Input]
   [perl]
   my $type        = $CGI->{mv_searchtype};
   my $spell_check = $CGI->{mv_spelling_errors};
   my $out = '';
   if($spell_check and $type eq 'text') {
       $CGI->{mv_todo}     = 'return';
       $CGI->{mv_nextpage} = 'special/cannot_spell_check';
   }
   return;
   [/perl]
   [/set]

=head2 Checks and Selections

A "memory" for drop-down menus, radio buttons, and checkboxes can be
provided with the C<[checked]> and C<[selected]> tags.

=over 4

=item [checked var_name value]

named attributes: C<[checked name="var_name" value="value" cgi=0|1
multiple=0|1 default=0|1 case=0|1]>

This will output CHECKED if the variable C<var_name> is equal to
C<value>. Set the C<cgi> attribute to use cgi instead of values data.
Not case sensitive unless C<case> is set.

If the C<multiple> attribute is defined and set to a non-zero value (1
is implicit) and if the value matches on a word/non-word boundary, it
will be CHECKED. If the C<default> attribute is set to a non-zero
value, the box will be checked if the variable C<var_name> is empty or
zero.

=item [selected var_name value]

named attributes: C<[selected name="var_name" value="value" cgi=0|1
multiple=0|1 default=0|1 case=0|1]>

This will output SELECTED if the variable C<var_name> is equal to
C<value>. Set the C<cgi> attribute to use cgi instead of values data.
Not case sensitive unless C<case> is set.

If the C<multiple> argument is present, it will look for any of a
variety of values. If the C<default> attribute is set, SELECT will be
output if the variable is empty or zero. Not case sensitive unless
C<case> is set.

Here is a drop-down menu that remembers an item-modifier color
selection:

    <SELECT NAME="c    <OPTION [selected name=color value=blue]> Blue
    <OPTION [selected name=color value=green]> Green
    <OPTION [selected name=color value=red]> Red
    </SELECT>

lor">

For databases or large lists of items, sometimes it is easier to use
C<[loop list="foo bar"]> and its C<option> parameter. The above can be
achieved with:

    <SELECT NAME=    [loop list="Blue Green Red" option=color]
    <OPTION> [loop-code]
    [/loop]
    </SELECT>

olor>

=back

=head2 Integrated Image Maps

Imagemaps can also be defined on forms, with the special form variable
C<mv_todo.map>. A series of map actions can be defined. The action
specified in the I<default> entry will be applied if none of the other
coordinates match. The image is specified with a standard HTML 2.0
form field of type IMAGE. Here is an example:

 <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME="mv_todo.map" VALUE="rect submit 0,0 100,20">
<INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME="mv_todo.map" VALUE="rect cancel 290,2 342,18">
<INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME="mv_todo.map" VALUE="default refresh">
<INPUT TYPE=image  NAME="mv_todo" SRC="url_of_image">

All of the actions will be combined together into one image map with
NCSA-style functionality (see the NCSA imagemap documentation for
details), except that Interchange form actions are defined instead of
URLs.

=head2 Setting Form Security

You can cause a form to be submitted securely (to the base URL in the
SecureURL directive, that is) by specifying your form input to be
ACTION="[process secure=1]".

To submit a form to the regular non-secure server, just omit the
C<secure> modifier.

=head2 Stacking Variables on the Form

Many Interchange variables can be "stacked," meaning they can have
multiple values for the same variable name. As an example, to allow
the user to order multiple items with one click, set up a form like
this:

 <FORM METHOD=POST ACTION="[process-order]">
<input type=checkbox name="mv_order_item" value="M3243"> Item M3243
<input type=checkbox name="mv_order_item" value="M3244"> Item M3244
<input type=checkbox name="mv_order_item" value="M3245"> Item M3245
<input type=hidden name="mv_doit" value="refresh">
<input type=submit name="mv_junk" value="Order Checked Items">
</FORM>

The stackable C<mv_order_item> variable with be decoded with multiple
values, causing the order of any items that are checked.

To place a "delete" checkbox on the shopping basket display:

 <FORM METHOD=POST ACTION="[process-order]">
[item-list]
  <input type=checkbox name="[quantity-name]" value="0"> Delete
  Part number: [item-code]
  Quantity: <input type=text name="[quantity-name]" value="[item-quantity]">
  Description: [item-description]
[/item-list]
<input type=hidden name="mv_doit" value="refresh">
<input type=submit name="mv_junk" value="Order Checked Items">
</FORM>

In this case, first instance of the variable name set by
C<[quantity-name]> will be used as the order quantity, deleting the
item from the form.

Of course, not all variables are stackable. Check the documentation
for which ones can be stacked or experiment.

=head2 Extended Value Access and File Upload

Interchange has a facility for greater control over the display of
form variables; it also can parse C<multipart/form-data> forms for
file upload.

File upload is simple. Define a form like:

   <FORM ACTION="[process-target] METHOD=POST ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data">
   <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=mv_todo     VALUE=return>
   <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=mv_nextpage VALUE=test>
   <INPUT TYPE=file NAME=newfile>
   <INPUT TYPE=submit VALUE="Go!">
   </FORM>

The [value-extended ...] tag performs the fetch and storage of the
file. If the following is on the C<test.html> page (as specified with
C<mv_nextpage> and used with the above form, it will write the file
specified:

   <PRE>
   Uploaded file name: [value-extended name=newfile]
   Is newfile a file? [value-extended name=newfile yes=Yes no=No test=isfile]

   Write the file. [value-extended name=newfile outfile=junk.upload]
   Write again with
    indication: [value-extended name=newfile
                               outfile=junk.upload
                               yes="Written."]
                               no=FAILED]

   And the file contents:
   [value-extended name=newfile file_contents=1]
   </PRE>

The [value-extended] tag also allows access to the array values of
stacked variables. Use the following form:

   <FORM ACTION="[process-target] METHOD=POST ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data">
   <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=testvar VALUE="value0">
   <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=testvar VALUE="value1">
   <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=testvar VALUE="value2">
   <INPUT TYPE=submit VALUE="Go!">
   </FORM>

and page:

   testvar element 0: [value-extended name=testvar index=0]
   testvar element 1: [value-extended name=testvar index=1]
   testvar elements:
    joined with a space:   |[value-extended name=testvar]|
    joined with a newline: |[value-extended
                               joiner="\n"
                               name=testvar
                               index="*"]|
    first two only:    |[value-extended
                               name=testvar
                               index="0..1"]|
    first and last:    |[value-extended
                               name=testvar
                               index="0,2"]|

to observe this in action.

The syntax for C<[value-extended ...]> is:

 named: [value-extended
           name=formfield
           outfile=filename*
           ascii=1*
           yes="Yes"*
           no="No"*
           joiner="char|string"*
           test="isfile|length|defined"*
           index="N|N..N|*"
           file_contents=1*
           elements=1*]

positional: [value-extended name]

Expands into the current value of the customer/form input field named
by field. If there are multiple elements of that variable, it will
return the value at C<index>; by default all joined together with a
space.

If the variable is a file variable coming from a multipart/form-data
file upload, then the contents of that upload can be returned to the
page or optionally written to the C<outfile>.

=over 4

=item name

The form variable NAME. If no other parameters are present, the value
of the variable will be returned. If there are multiple elements, by
default they will all be returned joined by a space. If C<joiner> is
present, they will be joined by its value.

In the special case of a file upload, the value returned is the name
of the file as passed for upload.

=item joiner

The character or string that will join the elements of the array. It
will accept string literals such as "\n" or "\r".

=item test

There are three tests. C<isfile> returns true if the variable is a
file upload. C<length> returns the length. C<defined> returns whether
the value has ever been set at all on a form.

=item index

The index of the element to return if not all are wanted. This is
useful especially for pre-setting multiple search variables. If set to
C<*>, it will return all (joined by C<joiner>). If a range, such as
C<0 .. 2>, it will return multiple elements.

=item file_contents

Returns the contents of a file upload if set to a non-blank, non-zero
value. If the variable is not a file, it returns nothing.

=item outfile

Names a file to write the contents of a file upload to. It will not
accept an absolute file name; the name must be relative to the catalog
directory. If images or other files are to be written to go to HTML
space, use the HTTP server's C<Alias> facilities or make a symbolic
link.

=item ascii

To do an auto-ASCII translation before writing the C<outfile>, set the
C<ascii> parameter to a non-blank, non-zero value. The default is no
translation.

=item yes

The value that will be returned if a test is true or a file is written
successfully. It defaults to C<1> for tests and the empty string for
uploads.

=item no

The value that will be returned if a test is false or a file write
fails. It defaults to the empty string.

=back

=head2 Updating Interchange Database Tables with a Form

Any Interchange database can be updated with a form using the
following method. The Interchange user interface uses this facility
extensively.

B<Note: >All operations are performed on the database, not the ASCII
source file. An [export table_name] operation will have to be
performed for the ASCII source file to reflect the results of the
update. Records in any  database may be inserted or updated with the
[query] tag, but form-based updates or inserts may also be performed.

In an update form, special Interchange variables are used to select
the database parameters:

=over 4

=item mv_data_enable (scratch)

\IMPORTANT: This must be set to a non-zero, non-blank value in the
scratch space to allow data set functions. Usually it is put in an
mv_click that precedes the data set function. For example:

    [set update_dat    [if type=data term="userdb::trusted::[data session username]"]
        [set mv_data_enable]1[/set]
    [else]
        [set mv_data_enable]0[/set]
    [/else]
    [/if]
    [/set]
    <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=mv_click VALUE=update_database>

base]

=item mv_data_table

The table to update.

=item mv_data_key

The field that is the primary key in the table. It must match the
existing database definition.

=item mv_data_function

UPDATE, INSERT or DELETE. The variable C<mv_data_verify> must be set
true on the form for a DELETE to occur.

=item mv_data_verify

Confirms a DELETE.

=item mv_data_fields

Fields from the form which should be inserted or updated. Must be
existing columns in the table in question.

=item mv_update_empty

Normally a variable that is blank will not replace the field. If
C<mv_update_empty> is set to true, a blank value will erase the field
in the database.

=item mv_data_filter_(field)

Instantiates a filter for C<(field)>, using any of the defined
Interchange filters. For example, if C<mv_data_filter_foo> is set to
C<digits>, only digits will be passed into the database field during
the set operation. A common value might be "entities", which protects
any HTML by translating C<<> into C<&lt;>, C<"> into C<&quot;>, etc.

=back

The Interchange action set causes the update. Here are a pair of
example forms. One is used to set the key to access the record
(careful with the name, this one goes into the user session values).
The second actually performs the update. It uses the C<[loop]> tag
with only one value to place default/existing values in the form based
on the input from the first form:

   <FORM METHOD=POST ACTION="[process]">
    <INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN name="mv_doit" value="return">
    <INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN name="mv_nextpage" value="update_proj">
    Sales Order Number <INPUT TYPE=TEXT SIZE=8
                            NAME="update_code"
                            VALUE="[value update_code]">
    <INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT name="mv_submit"  Value="Select">
    </FORM>
<FORM METHOD=POST ACTION="[process]">
   <INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME="mv_data_table"    VALUE="ship_status">
   <INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME="mv_data_key"      VALUE="code">
   <INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME="mv_data_function" VALUE="update">
   <INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME="mv_nextpage"      VALUE="updated">
   <INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME="mv_data_fields"
               VALUE="code,custid,comments,status">
   <PRE>

   [loop arg="[value update_code]"]
   Sales Order <INPUT TYPE=TEXT NAME="code    SIZE=10 VALUE="[loop-code]">
  Customer No. <INPUT TYPE=TEXT NAME="custid" SIZE=30
                   VALUE="[loop-field custid]">
      Comments <INPUT TYPE=TEXT NAME="comments"
                   SIZE=30 VALUE="[loop-field comments]">
        Status <INPUT TYPE=TEXT NAME="status"
                   SIZE=10 VALUE="[loop-field status]">
   [/loop]
   </PRE>

       <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME="mv_todo" VALUE="set">
       <INPUT TYPE=submit VALUE="Update table">
   </FORM>

The variables in the form do not update the user's session values, so
they can correspond to database field names without fear of corrupting
the user session.

Frequently Asked Questions

How do you pass variables from page to page?

No effort needed. Interchange does this automatically. Every user
session that is started by Interchange automatically creates a
variable set for the user. As long as the user session is maintained,
and does not expire, any variables you set on a form will be
"remembered" in future sessions.

Don't use the prefix mv_ for your own variables. Interchange treats
these specially and they may not behave as you wish. Use the mv_
variables only as they are documented.

Also, because you can set so many variables, Interchange does not
unset variables it does not find on the current form. That means you
can't expect a checkbox to become unchecked unless you explicitly
reset it.

How can I tell when I need to quote a tag inside a tag?

In general, you don't need to quote the following tags which are
interpreted first within a list:

   [item-code] [item-data ...] [item-field ...] etc.
   [loop-code] [loop-data ...] [loop-field ...] etc.
   [foo-code]  [foo-data ...]   [foo-field ...] etc.

This is because they are interpreted as a part of the surrounding
C<[loop]>, C<[item-list]>, C<[search-list]>, C<[sql list]>, or C<[tag
each table]> constructs.

So this will work:

   [item-list]
   [page [item-field url]]detailed info[/page] on [item-description]
   [/item-list]

This will I<not> work:

   [page [value mypage]]

The [value ...] tag is not interpolated before page, and the parser
will not know to do so. It needs to be instead:

   [page href="[value mypage]"]

You might wonder why unquoted tags are even allowed. The answer is
performance. If you have large lists of tags you can achieve
significant speedups by using positional parameters. It requires CPU
power to parse and disassemble the named parameters.

Can I use Interchange with my existing static catalog pages?

Yes, but you probably won't want to in the long run. Interchange is
designed to build pages based on templates from a database. If all you
want is a shopping cart, you can mix standard static pages with
Interchange, but it is not as convenient and doesn't take advantage of
the many dynamic features Interchange offers.

That being said, all you usually have to do to place an order link on
a page is:

   <A HREF="/cgi-bin/construct/order?mv_order_item=SKU_OF_ITEM">Order!</A>

Replace C</cgi-bin/construct> with the path to your Interchange link.

Template Parsing Order

Under normal circumstances, the template page containing tags and HTML
is parsed in the following order:

=over 4

=item 1.

Any content in MV_AUTOLOAD is prepended to the template page.

=over 8

=item

I<>

=back

I<>

=item 2.

Any [C<pragma>] tags anywhere in the text are processed, and the
specified pragmas are set.

=over 8

=item *

Since [C<pragma>] tags are preprocessed before any other content,
C<reparse> will not catch them, nor will they work if included in
variables. Also, the specified pragma will apply to the entire
template (not just the section after the tag).

=item *

If you want to apply a pragma with a variable or only to part of a
document, you must use [C<tag> pragma="..."] instead.

=back

I<>

=item 3.

Variables (macros) are processed in the following order:

=over 8

=item 4.

@@VARNAME@@ global variables

=item 5.

@_VARNAME_@ local or global variables

=item 6.

__VARNAME__ local variables

=back

I<>

=item 7.

Interchange comments are stripped.

=over 8

=item

I<>

=back

I<>

=item 8.

False-endtag macros are expanded (e.g., [C</page>] and [C</order>]).

=over 8

=item

I<>

=back

I<>

=item 9.

'<!--[tagname]-->' escapes are converted to [tagname]

=over 8

=item *

This can be a convenience for your HTML editor if it has trouble with
tags using the standard [tagname] syntax.

=item *

However, if you want to HTML-comment out an interchange tag in content
that will be fed raw to a browser, you must include whitespace, like
this, '<!-- [tagname] -->'.

=back

I<>

=item 10.

The main tag parser is called.

=over 8

=item *

Some tags parse recursively (depending on C<reparse> and
C<interpolate> settings, of course).

=item *

Some tags (e.g., [C<loop>]) process prefix-tags in their contained
body text.  The prefix-tags are not handled recursively.

=back

I<>

=item 11.

Image paths substitution on the HTML output occurs.

=over 8

=item

I<>

=back

I<>

=back

B<Nonstandard parsing within the admin interface>

Parsing of content via the specialized C<regenerate> usertag included
with the administrative interface does not obey the above order.  The
MV_AUTOLOAD and '<!--[tagname]-->' escapes are skipped.  There are
some other more subtle differences as well; in the very unlikely event
that you need to check this in the source code, compare the
'interpolate_html' and 'cache_html' routines in Interpolate.pm.
