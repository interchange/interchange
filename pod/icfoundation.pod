icfoundation - Foundation Store

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 The Foundation Store

The Foundation store is distributed with Interchange to give you a
starting point with which to build your e-business. While the
Foundation store is designed to be relatively easy to start with, it
is still a full-featured demonstration of a number of Interchange
capabilities. Once you understand the Foundation store and how it
works you are well on your way to understanding the Interchange
software.

The following is a list of some popular features:

=over 4

=item Category Searches

Regardless of the number of products in a catalog, categorizing them
makes them easier to find. Pick a field in the database, typically
named category, and classify the products for search using
Interchange.

=item Images

You can display a thumbnail image for the items that have images. To
do this, add an image field in the database. (See the 'image' field of
the products database.)

=item Related Items

You can embed searches of similar products on an individual product
display page with the [query ...] or [loop ...] tags. Or, if
customer data is developed, search a past order database and display
products that would be of interest to that customer.

=item Reviews/Testimonials

You can key the placement of a review or testimonial on the existence
of a file being in a certain directory. This is reasonable to do when
a user is viewing a single product.

=back

=head1 Tree design

By determining how users will enter and exit the catalog, complex and
intelligent conditional schemes are possible, especially if the
Cookies capability is exercised. However, it is recommended that
simplicity be used. Consumers will not make purchases if they can't
navigate their way around the catalog.

It is important to remember that users will lose their session (and
items in their shopping cart) if their browser does not accept cookies
and they leave the site. Interchange addresses this problem by using
the area and page tags. If you are  using frames, source all
frame panes containing Interchange links from an initial page served
by Interchange. If you don't do this, the user may have multiple
session IDs depending on which frame generated the link.

Note that Interchange can work properly even if the browser doesn't
store cookies. In this situation Interchange inserts a session ID into
each URL; if the ID is preserved as the user navigates from page to
page the session will remain intact.

=head1 The Catalog Directory

Interchange pages are contained in the catalog directory. Each
individual catalog has its own base directory. The catalog directory
has the following structure by default:

=over 4

=item catalog.cfg

File containing configuration directives for a particular catalog.
Configuration settings established in the catalog.cfg directory will
not effect any other catalogs running under the version of Interchange
you are using. Subcatalogs can have differing information in a file
named for that subcatalog.

=item config

Directory that will be read when directives are set with the
filename notation. For example, the file config/static.pages
will be read when the following directive is encountered in the
catalog.cfg file.

  StaticPage  <static.pages

This directory also contains template information used with the
makecat program.

=item error.log

File which contains catalog-specific errors. It is also where any
syntax errors in embedded Perl code are shown.

=item etc

Directory normally used for tracking files, order profiles, and other
configuration and log information.

=item pages

Directory that contains the pages of the catalog. This can be
considered to be the "document root" of the catalog. Pages contained
therein are called with the path information after the script name.
For example:

/cgi-bin/simple/products/gold will call the page in thpages/products/gold.html.

 file

=item products

Directory that contains database source files, including the special
Interchange databases shipping.asc, pricing.asc (and other shipping
database files).

=item session

Directory that contains session files.

=item tmp

The temporary or scratch directory used for various storage reasons,
like retired ID numbers, search paging files, sort tests, import
temporary files, etc. This is the default set by ScratchDir. It can be
redefined to be located on another partition.

=back

=head1 Page Templates

This section describes the files located in the Foundation demo.

=head2 Template File Locations

This diagram shows the directory and file structure used for the
default Foundation 'templates' directory. The base will be a directory
with the name of your catalog, here called CATROOT.

=head2 Themes

This section explains how themes are defined in Interchange via the
STYLE variable and the theme configuration file, theme.cfg.

STYLE

The STYLE variable in CATROOT/products/variable.txt indicates the
template style to be used as the theme for the catalog; the
appropriate templates for that theme are found in
CATROOT/templates/__STYLE__/. (To change the value of the STYLE
variable, either edit variable.txt directly or use the table editor
feature of the admin interface.)

The default theme for Interchange is the Foundation demo; hence, the
STYLE variable is assigned the value 'Foundation' in variable.txt. The
theme is defined in catalog.cfg as S<follows (line numbers added):>

    # Here we set up the catalog theme.

  1 ParseVariables Yes

  2 ifndef STYLE
  3 Variable STYLE default
  4 endif
  5 include templates/__STYLE__/theme.cfg

Variables that make up the look and feel of the STYLE (theme) are
defined in the file CATROOT/templates/foundation/theme.cfg, which is
read by Interchange in line 5 above.

theme.cfg

The file CATROOT/templates/foundation/theme.cfg serves three
S<purposes:>

=over 4

=item 1.

It defines the THEME and THEME_IMG_DIR variables,

=item 2.

It defines a cascading style sheet for the theme, and

=item 3.

It defines the location of region templates according to the traffic
settings for the Interchange daemon.

=back

The THEME variable is used to set the location of the region templates
in the traffic settings section of the theme.cfg file. It is also used
in the cart template definition file (CATROOT/templates/cart) to set
the path of an image. The THEME_IMG_DIR variable is used to set image
paths in the template region files and the template component files.

The look and feel of the Foundation theme are defined primarily in the
cascading style sheet specified in the theme.cfg file. This

The Interchange TRAFFIC setting, defined system-wide in
interchange.cfg, is described in the ??document??. The settings in
theme.cfg pertain to the location of region templates for the high and
low traffic settings. For example, if you need to define a separate
set of high traffic templates, you would change the ConfigDir variable
in theme.cfg to point to the directory containing those templates.

=head2 Template Definition Files

The template definition files store the name and description of the
template as well as components and options for that template.

    templates/cart
    templates/fullwidth
    templates/leftonly
    templates/leftright

    templates/foundation/cart
    templates/foundation/fullwidth
    templates/foundation/leftonly
    templates/foundation/leftright
    templates/foundation/simple

Template Walkthrough -- leftonly

This section is best read while viewing the file
CATROOT/templates/leftonly and the 'Edit Page' page in the Content
Editor of the Interchange Administration Tool.

Looking at the example template definition file, all lines located
between the [comment] and [/comment] tags (lines 1 and 53) control
what is available in the Edit Page screen of the Administration Tool.

B<Lines 2-5:> Template specification

    2  ui_template: Yes
    3  ui_template_name: leftonly
    4  ui_template_layout: LEFTONLY_TOP, UI_CONTENT, LEFTONLY_BOTTOM
    5  ui_template_description: Page with top/left areas.

Line 2 indicates that this file is a template for the user interface.
Line 3 names the template, while Line 4 indicates the regions that
comprise the template and that will eventually make up the new page
that is created from the template. Line 5 provides a description used
to identify the template when it appears in a Select Template
pull-down menu on the Edit Page of the Administration Tool. This
description can be changed or modified to better describe a new
template or a template that is created from the stock templates
provided with Interchange.

B<Lines 7-8:> Break

    7  break:
    8          widget: break

This code creates a separation line in the Edit Page between sets of
options. In the default Interchange installation the line is grey, but
the color can be changed. Note - Changing this color applies the
change to any catalog served by Interchange.

B<Lines 10-11:> Page Title

    10 page_title:
    11         description: Page title

This code tells Interchange to display a text field on the Edit Page
for entering the page title ('Title of New Page' in this example). The
value entered is assigned to the scratch variable page_title and is
set as a default value at the bottom of the template definition file
using the following S<ITL:>

    54 [set page_title][set]

which, in turn, sets the scratch variable on the new page using the
tag

    [set page_title]Title of New Page[set]

The scratch variable page_title is parsed by the following code in the
region template specified in the template definition file and called
in the new S<page:>

       <title>[scratch page_title]</title>

B<Lines 13-15:> Page Banner

    13 page_banner:
    14         description: Page banner
    15         help: Defaults to page title

Assigns a textual title for the page to the scratch variable
page_banner, which is assigned by the following S<ITL:>

    55 [set page_banner][set]

The scratch variable page_banner is set on the new page using the tag

    [set page_banner]Banner of New Page[set]

The scratch variable can be parsed in the region template by this
S<code:>

    [either]
        [scratch page_banner]
    [or]
        [scratch page_title]
    [/either]

This results in the page banner being displayed if defined. Otherwise,
the page title is used.

B<Lines 17-20:> Members Only

    17 members_only:
    18         options: 1=Yes,0=No*
    19         widget: radio
    20         description: Members only

This creates a radio-button form element on the Edit Page with the
user can specify whether the page can be accessed if a visitor is
logged in (Yes) or not (No). The default is indicated by an asterisk.

The scratch variable members_only is assigned by the ITL code

    56 [set members_only][set]

and set on the new page using the tag

       [set members_only]0[/set]

if the page can be accessed without logging in or

       [set members_only]1[/set]

if it can not.

The members_only function is handled by the following code within each
region template S<file:>

    [if scratch members_only]
      [set members_only][/set]
      [if !session logged_in]
        [set mv_successpage]@@MV_PAGE@@[/set]
        [bounce page=login]
      [/if]
    [/if]

This code says that if "members only" is set to yes, and the visitor
is logged in, to display the page. Otherwise, redirect the visitor to
the login page.

    22 break1:

Another separation line.

B<Lines 25-28:> Horizontal Before Component

    25 component_before:
    26         options: =none, best_horizontal=Best Sellers, cross_horizontal=Cross sell, \
                promo_horizontal=Promotion, random_horizontal=Random items, \
                upsell_horizontal=Upsell
    27         widget: select
    28         description: Component before content

This allows the inclusion of a defined component (included in the
CATROOT/templates/components directory) to be displayed before, or
above, the page's content. It provides a pull-down menu on the Edit
Page displaying the available components. The components, identified
here on line 26, can be assigned a name via the value=name convention.

The scratch variable component_before is assigned in the template
definition file by the ITL code

    57 [set component_before][set]

It is called with the following code within the LEFTRIGHT_TOP,
LEFTONLY_TOP, and NOLEFT_TOP region S<templates:>

    [if scratch component_before]
      [include file="templates/components/[scratch component_before]"]
    [/if]

B<Lines 30-33:> Horizontal After Component

    30 component_after:
    31         options: =none, best_horizontal=Best Sellers, cross_horizontal=Cross sell, \
                promo_horizontal=Promotion, random_horizontal=Random items, \
                upsell_horizontal=Upsell
    32         widget: select
    33         description: Component after content

Similar to component_before, this allows the inclusion of a defined
component after, or below, the page's content.

The scratch variable component_before is assigned in the template
definition file by the ITL code

    58 [set component_after][set]

It is called with the following code within the LEFTRIGHT_BOTTOM and
LEFTONLY_BOTTOM region S<templates:>


    [if scratch component_after]
      [include file="templates/components/[scratch component_after]"]
    [/if]

B<Lines 35-38:> Horizontal Item Width

    35 component_hsize:
    36         options: 1,2,3*
    37         widget: select
    38         description: Component items horizontal

This setting allows you to choose how many items the horizontal
components display. For example, the horizontal best sellers component
("best_horizontal") uses this setting to randomly select the best
sellers. Notice the default is 3 if nothing is defined. It is called
by the following code in the promo_horizontal and random_horizontal
components in the Foundation demo.

    random="[either][scratch component_hsize][or]2[/either]"

B<Lines 40-45:> Before/After Banner

    40 hbanner:

    44         description: Before/after Banner
    45         help: Banner for Before/after component

Allows a title for the horizontal components to be defined to be
displayed in a header above the component's items. It is called with
the [scratch hbanner] tag and used in the Foundation demo in the
random_horizontal component.

B<Lines 47-51:> Special Tag

    47 hpromo_type:
    48         options: specials=Specials, new=New items
    49         widget: select
    50         description: Special tag
    51         help: Only for a horizontal Promotion

This setting is only viable when a promotion is used for a horizontal
component. It tells the promotional component which row(s) to evaluate
in the merchandising table for display within the component. This
setting, used in the promo_horizontal component, typically correlates
to the featured column of the merchandising table as S<follows:>

    [query arrayref=main
           sql="
            SELECT sku,timed_promotion,start_date,finish_date
            FROM merchandising
            WHERE featured = '[scratch hpromo_type]'
            "]
    [/query]

=head2 Edit Page Function

Creating a page with the following specifications using the Edit Page
function results in the HTML and ITL code displayed below.

    @_LEFTONLY_TOP_@

    <!-- BEGIN CONTENT -->
    <P>My first HTML/ITL page!
    <!-- END CONTENT -->

    @_LEFTONLY_BOTTOM_@

An important point demonstrated here is the inclusion of the region
templates LEFTONLY_TOP and LEFTONLY_BOTTOM through the
@_VARIABLE_NAME_@ notation. These are included because of line 4 of
the leftonly template definition S<file:>

    4  ui_template_layout: LEFTONLY_TOP, UI_CONTENT, LEFTONLY_BOTTOM

However, understand that you are free to change the region templates
used in the file by editing the file itself or, better yet, using an
existing region as a starting point for a region of your own design.

The next section explains the structure of region templates.

=head2 Region Templates

Interchange region templates (or "regions") are portions of HTML and
ITL that are included in pages within a catalog. Using regions, along
with the cascading style sheet defined in theme.cfg, allows you to
control the look and feel of specific parts of each catalog page.

The default Foundation region set, found in
CATROOT/templates/foundation/regions, includes the S<following:>

    LEFTONLY_TOP
    LEFTONLY_BOTTOM
    LEFTRIGHT_TOP
    LEFTRIGHT_BOTTOM
    NOLEFT_TOP
    NOLEFT_BOTTOM

The Foundation demo uses the Variable feature extensively to simplify
hand page editing. Basically, a Variable is a define that permits the
substitution of text for a simple __VARIABLE__ string in a page. For
example, in the test page above, the variables LEFTONLY_TOP and
LEFTONLY_BOTTOM correspond to region templates that provide a logobar,
menubar, leftside menu, and copyright footer. Content, consisting of
HTML and ITL, is placed within the BEGIN and END CONTENT comments. The
following illustration shows how this looks on the S<page:>

   +--------------------------------------------------------+
   |                      LOGOBAR                           |

In this diagram, LEFTONLY_TOP contributes the LEFTSIDE, LOGOBAR, and
MENUBAR sections, while LEFTONLY_BOTTOM contributes the COPYRIGHT
section.

The following subsections provide an inventory of where each of the
region templates, included with the Foundation demo, are used in the
pages and template definition files that make up the catalog.

These lines control what is shown in the Edit page screen of the admin
interface.

     8  <!-- BEGIN COMPONENT [control component cart_display] -->

Line 8 is an HTML comment noting the start of the code for the
component. (Note that this can serve as a useful debugging tool to
help you locate the component in the resulting HTML generated by
Interchange when you view the source of a page loaded in the browser.)

     9  [if items]

Line 9 checks to see if there are items in the shopping basket. If
there are, the remaining code up to the closing [/if] tag on line 64
is executed. If not, Interchanges continues executing the remaining
code in results.html (the file that calls the cart_display component).

[item-list] tag on line 31 tells Interchange to execute the code up to
the closing tag ([/item-list] on line 59 for each item the customer
has ordered so far.

    33      <tr class="[item-alternate 2]maincontent[else]contentbar1[/else][/item-alternate]">
    34        <td align=center valign=top>

    39        </TD>
    40

Line 33 begins the next row in the table. The [item-alternate] tag
provided as the value of the class attribute tells Interchange to
alternate between displaying the rows according to the "maincontent"
and "contentbar1" styles (gray and white, respectively).

Lines 34-36 create a link to the shopping cart (basket.html) where the
customer can remove or change the quantity of the item ordered.

Line 37 displays the SKU of the item. Lines 38 and 39 provide a link
to the product display page (flypage.html) for the item. The
[item-description] tag providing the content of the [page] tag enables
the item's name to be displayed as the link to the product display
page.

Line 41 checks whether the item is a gift certificate. If it is it
displays "Amount of gift:" and the [item-quantity] (number of gift
certificates, in this case) under the headings "Quantity" and "Price",
respectively. Otherwise, lines 48 through 50 display the quantity and
price of the item ordered. Lines 45 or 53 (depending on whether the
item is a gift certificate) display the item subtotal (quantity
multiplied by price) for the item under the heading "Extension".

I<affiliate>

Example Data

   consolidated
   hardhat

This field contains the unique Affiliate ID.

I<name>

Example Data

   Consolidated Diversified
   Hardhat Construction

This is the descriptive name of the affiliate.

I<campaigns>

Example Data

   coupon

This field lists the campaigns that the affiliate participates and
enables campaign features and tracks traffic from advertising
campaigns. The foundation catalog implements a coupon campaign in the
affiliate_receptor component.  If you want to add campaigns, you will
also need to develop the appropriate logic within the
affiliate_receptor component and pages that use it.

I<coupon_amount>

Example Data

   5

This is the discount offered customers from the affiliate
participating in the coupon campaign.

Note --  This is implemented in the affiliate_receptor component as a
flat discount amount. If you wanted a percentage discount instead, you
would modify the [discount] tag in
catalog_root/templates/components/affiliate_receptor (see the
[discount] tag for more detail).

I<join_date>

Example Data

   20000827
   20000910

This is the date when the affiliate signed with you.

I<url>

Example Data

   http://demo.akopia.com/~hardhat
   http://www.minivend.com/consolidated/

The value in this field is used to direct visitors coming from the
Affiliate to your home page or a page you have designed specifically
for visitors from that Affiliate's site. Note that this should I<not>
be the URL of the Affiliate's home site.

I<timeout>

Example Data

   0
   3600

The value in this field is used to specify the amount of time a
customer has to place an order to still give the Affiliate credit for
it. If the customer goes over this amount of time, the Affiliate
doesn't get credit for the customer visit. The timeout delay is
measured in seconds, with the value of 0 (zero) disabling it. It is
recommended that you use a value in the thousands to make sure the
customer has enough time to shop.

I<active>

This is a boolean value indicating whether the affiliate is active.

I<password>

Example Data

   akopia

Password for affiliate login (see
catalog_root//pages/affiliate/login.html). Note that the password is
stored in plaintext by default.

I<image>

Example Data

   http://demo.akopia.com/~hardhat/images/logo.gif
   http://www.minivend.com/consolidated/conslogo.gif

Affiliate's logo image.

=head2 area

cat_root/products/area.txt

This table is used to implement dynamic navigation bars. For example,
it is used in the category_horizontal and category_vertical
components. Note the similarity to the B<cat> table, since both
B<area> and B<cat> tables supply data for building links to results
pages.

When building entries in a navigation bar, it is the  B<bar_link>
subroutine in the /dist/catalog_before.cfg configuration file that
actually reads and processes the values from the table.

   00
   03
   04
   05
   06

Lexographic (alphanumeric) sorting prefix.  Note use of '03' rather
than '3', which would sort after '13'. This controls the order of the
categories in your navigation bar.

If this is not set, your navbar entries will sort in alphabetical
order.

I<display_type>

Example Data

   name
   icon
   url
   image

What to use for the labels in the navigation bar (for example, name,
icon, url or image). The navigation bars in the foundation catalog are
set up with 'name' display_type.

 display type                      Link shown as

I<banner_image>

Example Data

   promo_image.gif

This field is not related to banner ads.  It is useful if you want to
pass to your results page an image that is specific for the navbar
entry (perhaps to display a banner above your results).

If you are using an Interchange search for your links (i.e., 'simple'
or 'complex' B<link_type>), then this will add
'va=banner_image=B<banner_image>' to the resulting search
specification. This puts the contents of B<banner_image> into the
Values hash of your search results page.  You can access it with
[value banner_image] (see the value tag). You will have to
modify the standard results page (or set up and specify your own) in
order to display the image.

   <IMG src="[value banner_image]" alt="[value banner_text]">

The foundation catalog does not implement banner_image in the
preconfigured navigation bars.

I<banner_text>

Example Data

   This Is A Title For Hand Tools

This field is not related to banner ads.  It is useful if you want to
pass to your results page some text that is specific for the navbar
entry (perhaps to display a title above your results).

If you are using an Interchange search for your links (i.e., 'simple'
or 'complex' B<link_type>), then this will add
'va=banner_text=B<banner_text>' to the resulting search specification.
This puts the contents of B<banner_text> into the Values hash of your
search results page.  You can access it with [value banner_text]
(see the value tag). You will have to modify the standard results
page (or set up and specify your own) in order to display the text.

The foundation catalog does not implement banner_text in the
preconfigured navigation bars.

I<link_type>

Example Data

   none
   external
   internal
   simple
   complex

Link type to create in the navigation bar.

 Link type    Description
 none         No link
 external     External link. The HTML specified in url will go directly into the navigation bar.
 internal     Internal link. This will be highlit if it is the current page. If you specify both a page and a form for the link, the url field should contain "page form".  See the Search Engine documentation for more detail on search forms.
 simple       Allows you to specify an Interchange search with a few values. See the bar_link subroutine in the /dist/catalog_before.cfg configuration file for more detail.
 complex      Allows you to fully specify an Interchange search specification. See the bar_link subroutine in the /dist/catalog_before.cfg configuration file for more detail if you need to use these.

I<url>

Target URL (external link or internal page/search specification). See
B<link_type> . The foundation catalog navigation bars are not set up
with link types that use the B<url> field.

I<tab>

Database table file to use with 'simple' B<link_type> (searchspec
fi=B<tab>). The foundation catalog navigation bars are not set up with
link types that use the B<tab> field.

I<page>

Results page to use with 'simple' B<link_type> (searchspec
sp=B<page>). The foundation catalog navigation bars are not set up
with link types that use the B<page> field.

I<search>

Search spec used with 'complex' B<link_type>. See the Search Engine
documentation for more detail on search forms. The foundation catalog
navigation bars are not set up with link types that use the B<search>
field.

I<selector>

The selector that is used to scan the products table for products
in the category. Used with 'simple' B<link_type>. The foundation
catalog navigation bars are not set up with link types that use the
B<selector> field.

I<link_template>

Overrides the usual HTML link template for navbar entries.  See the
B<bar_link> subroutine in the /dist/catalog_before.cfg configuration
file if you need to modify link templates.

The foundation catalog navigation bars are not set up with link types
that use the B<link_template> field.

=head2 banner

cat_root/products/banner.txt

The banner ad table. The foundation catalog does not implement any
banner ads with this table.

You do not need to use this table to display ads served by third
parties (for example, doubleclick). Since most banner ads on the
internet are served by third parties and are not managed by your
catalog, you probably will not need to set up banners here unless you
do your own advertising.

See I<Banner/Ad rotation> in the template documentation for a detailed
description of the columns and content of the banner table.  Also, see
the banner tag documentation.

=head2 options

This table contains data for implementing simple, matrix and modular
options.

Simple options are options that a customer can combine arbitrarily,
such as size and color. The selected options might affect price.  See
the accessories tag for more detail on option values for simple
options.

Matrix options are preconfigured combinations of options. For example,
if you sell titanium and carbon-fiber bike frames, but offer only
certain combinations of frame material and color, your checkout page
might include a select box with only the following S<entries:>

=over 4

=item *

Silver Titanium: $1672

=item *

Black Titanium: $1672

=item *

Red Titanium: $1674

=item *

Black Carbon Fiber: $1290

=item *

Yellow Flame Carbon Fiber: $1300

=back

Note that there is no Yellow Flame Titanium offering, for example.

Modular options are like a structured bill of materials, where one
product is a master item and other products are subitems for that
master item. The subitems can also be master items to subitems at a
lower level. In addition, subitems may be designated as 'phantom',
which means that they are placeholders in the hierarchy of the
structured bill of materials with their own subitems, but are not
actual items themselves.

The foundation catalog with the computer data set uses modular
options.

For more information, see the following pages and components in the
foundation S<catalog:>

I<code>

Example Data

   1002
   1003
   1004
   1005

Unique ID for the option.

I<o_master>

Example Data

   00010
   999000
   999001
   999002

SKU of the master item for the option. The master item is one level up
in the modular hierarchy, and must be one of the S<following:>

=over 4

=item *

An item in the products table (matching B<products.sku>)

=item *

Another option in the options table (matching B<options.sku>)

=item *

A I<phantom> item in the B<options> table.

=back

If an option has a master item, then a customer can not choose that
option without having previously selected the master item.

The price for a master item is the sum of the master item's price and
the price for each of the subitems. Because the subitems are
recursively defined, the top-level item reflects the top level price
plus the price of all selected options.

I<sku>

Example Data

   00010
   999000
   7000015
   7000030

The sku for the item or option. This may not be unique for matrix
options or if an option that belongs to multiple B<o_master>s is
listed for each master.

I<o_group>

Example Data

   A
   B
   C
   I

Product group (scanned to see whether it applies to this product or
not)

I<o_sort>

Example Data

   01
   02
   03
   04
   47
   48
   49
   50

Sorting prefix for listing order of options.

I<phantom>

Modular options only.

Boolean - if true (1), then this is a phantom item acting as a
placeholder for other items rather than an actual product. The item's
B<sku> will not match an entry in the products table, though the
B<o_master> will match either the B<sku> of another phantom item in
the B<options> table or the B<sku> of an item in the B<products>
table.

I<o_enable>

Boolean - Enables subitems for this item or option. Note that an
option with B<o_enable> false may itself still be a subitem for an
option or item above it.

I<o_matrix>

Boolean. Set true (1) for matrix-type options.  See the options table
in the tools data set for examples of matrix options. Matrix options
that are part of a set have the same value for B<options.sku>.

I<o_modular>

Specifies a modular option.  See main heading for description of
modular options.

I<o_default>

Example Data

   1
   11002
   7000062
   7000087

Selects the default option for a group.

I<o_label>

Example Data

   Add a second hard drive
   Case Color
   Case color
   Case style
   Include tapes
   Red

This is the short name for option display.

I<o_value>

Example Data

   1=One 8GB tape,\r2=Two 8GB tapes,\r=None*
   a=One 8GB tape,\rb=Two 8GB tapes,\r=None*

   red=Passion Red,\rblue=Electric Blue,\rgreen=Sea Green,\rgrey=S...
   red=Passion Red,\ryellow=Lemon Yellow,\rblue=Electric Blue,\rgr...
   red=Rage Red,\ryellow=Honey Yellow

This is an Interchange value set for a simple option. It is typically
a comma-delimited list of labels and values with '*' indicating the
default value.  See the accessories tag for more detail.

Note that the "I<\r>" characters in the above example represent
carriage returns in the actual data ("\r" in perl, or Ctrl-M, or
hexadecimal 0D), and the ... indicates a line too long to show.

I<o_widget>

Example Data

   select

This determines the HTML Widget type (I<e.g.>, a select box).  For
example, the [options] tag uses this entry when building HTML
widgets in a page.  See also the [accessories] tag for available
widgets.

I<o_footer>

Example Data

Allowed Values

I<o_header>

Example Data

   Micro ATX Tower - Smoky Grey
   Super Tower Case (6)5.25 & (3)3.5

Longer description to show when displaying the options.

I<price>

Example Data

   0.00
   10
   20
   29
   75

This sets the retail price of the option.

I<wholesale>

Example Data

   13
   40.00

This sets the dealer price of the option.

I<differential>

Example Data

   -209
   -40
   -79

The phantom bill of materials for an option group can have a
differential, which is an amount to add to the base price of the
master product to get to a new base price that accommodates the
phantom bill of materials. Note that the differential can be negative.

For example, in the computer data set of the foundation catalog, SKU
00011 in the products table is an $849.95 pre-configured Athlon 800MHz
computer that includes a 17" monitor (in this case, SKU 7000087 in the
products table).

The monitor by itself would otherwise have cost $209. It is much more
convenient if you can use the same option part number and price for
each item.  To do this, you need a phantom option (in this case, SKU
999105 in the options table only) with a differential of -209 and the
available monitors as suboptions. When you include the phantom option
in the bill of materials for the computer (SKU 00011), the $-209
differential adjustment makes the price work out properly.

For instance, suppose that a $499 computer is configured as
S<follows:>

        500 MHz Athlon         --  $499
        32 MB SDRAM            --  ZERO
        10 GB disk             --  ZERO

        TOTAL                  --  $499

Suppose it costs $90 to upgrade the base computer to 128M of RAM and
$150 for a 30 GB hard disk.

If you also sell an 128MB 800 MHz $899 computer, and the customer
upgrades to the 30 GB hard disk,

        800 MHz Athlon          --  $899
        (memory differential)   --  $-90
        128 MB RAM              --   $90
        30 GB  disk             --  $150

        TOTAL                   -- $1039

If you did not have the differential, you would need a different
option part number for each item make the number come out right.

With the differential, you can use the same part number for 128MB RAM
no matter what the base part is. The price is always $90 -- there is
just a -90 differential when ordered with the 800MHz Athlon, making
the effective price zero.

I<weight>

Shipping weight of the option. Interchange uses this to calculate
shipping cost.

I<volume>

Volume added by the option.

I<mv_shipmode>

=head2 pricing

This database works in conjunction with the CommonAdjust directive
to allow quantity pricing for one product or for a group of products
(sometimes known as mix-and-match). The fields q2, q5, q10, etc.
are for the quantity levels; the price_group field selects the
mix-and-match category for the product.

I<sku>

Example Data

   gift_cert
   os28004
   os28006
   os28057c

Unique identifier for the product.  You should use only characters of
the class A-Z a-z 0-9 _ - (i.e., matching the regular expression,
'[-A-Za-z0-9_]+').  Although Interchange itself does not impose this
restriction, you may have problems with SQL databases, file systems,
and URL encoding if you use other characters. For example, a slash
(/) can interfere with URLs and filenames, a colon (:) can
interfere with database representations (or file names on some
operating systems), i<etc.>

I<description>

Example Data

   Brush Set
   Disposable Brush Set
   Ergo Roller
   Gift Certificate
   Painters Brush Set
   Painters Ladder
   Spackling Knife
   Trim Brush

A short description for the product that is used for displaying in the
shopping cart, receipt, and order report.

I<title>

Example Data

   Brush Set
   Disposable Brush Set
   Ergo Roller
   Gift Certificate
   Painters Brush Set
   Painters Ladder
   Spackling Knife
   Trim Brush

This column is not used in the foundation catalog. Previously used in
the Art store (simple) demo for a painting title. You probably want to
use B<description> instead.

You should modify the products and other tables to suit your catalog's
requirements. You might use this field if you want to show titles for
books, music, or other titled merchandise. If you do not use a title
that is distinct from the short description, then you probably do not
need this column in the table at all.

I<template_page>

Not used in foundation catalog.

No Description.

This is the field for a long description of the product. If you are
using an Interchange text/gdbm database, the field size is unlimited;
if using another type of database, the length will be dependent on the
field type selected.  If you are using a SQL database, see the
appropriate cat_root/dbconf subdirectory for a place to set COLUMN_DEF
values.  See also the database documentation, 'I<Importing from an
ASCII File>', for details about defaults for columns that you do not
define.

I<thumb>

Example Data

   gift_certificate.gif
   os28004_b.gif
   os28005_b.gif
   os28006_b.gif

This is the filename for a small (thumbnail) image of the product.

I<image>

Example Data

   gift_certificate_large.gif
   os28004.gif
   os28005.gif
   os28006.gif

This is the filename for a regular-sized image of the product, as it
should appear in an HTML <img src="B<image>"> tag. You do not need to
specify the path if the image files are in the usual Interchange image
directory.

I<price>

Example Data

   1.00
   12.99
   14.99
   9.99

The quantity-one price of the product.  See the B<wholesale> field and
the I<price> table for dealer and quantity pricing.

I<wholesale>

Example Data

   1
   10
   11
   12

This is the minimum dealer price for the item.  For quantity pricing,
see the I<price> table.

I<prod_group>

Example Data

   Hand Tools
   Hardware
   Ladders
   Measuring Tools
   Miscellaneous
   Painting Supplies
   Safety Equipment
   Tool Storage

Product group (supercategory).  This indicates the grouping of product
categories, for example in the navigation bars created from the
B<area> table (note the match with the B<name> data in the area
table).

I<category>

Example Data

   Brushes
   Gift Certificate
   Hammers
   Ladders
   Nails
   Paintbrushes
   Putty Knives
   Rollers

This is the category the product should appear in when you select a
list. You can put a product in more than one category, but you may
need to accommodate this in display and banner headings.  Embedded
perl is helpful for this.

I<nontaxable>

Boolean value.  If true (1), the sales tax calculation for an order
will not include the cost of the product.  See also the salestax
tag.

I<weight>

Example Data

   1
   2
   3

This is a numeric value of the weight used for determining shipping
costs (with UPS, for example).  In the US, this is typically the
weight in pounds in order to match the UPS, Fed Ex and other standard
shipping tables.

I<size>

Example Data

   1", 2", 3"
   1', 1.5'
   1/4", 1/2", 3/4", 1", 2", 3"
   10oz, 15oz, 20 oz
   2"
   6'
   set
   standard, metric

This is where the old Construct Something demo store kept the 'size'
options for a product.  The foundation catalog now uses the B<options>
table instead to handle product options (also sometimes called product
attributes).

The accessories tag can build HTML widgets from the comma-delimited
list of product options.  You can use a delimiter other than comma (if
compatible with the table) as long as you also set the delimiter in
the accessories tag.

You probably do not need this field if you use the options table (for
example, if you are building from the foundation catalog).

I<color>

Another product option column. No longer used in the foundation
catalog. See B<size> above for description.

I<gift_cert>

Boolean value.  If true (1), specifies that this product is a gift
certificate. See also the B<gift_certs> table.

I<related>

Used for displaying "upsells," opportunities to purchase an additional
item when this one is purchased. Contains a comma-separated list of
SKUs to be offered.

The foundation catalog now instead uses the B<upsell_to> field of the
B<merchandising> table for upselling.

I<featured>

Deprecated in favor of the  B<merchandising> table.

I<inactive>

If true (1), renders the product inactive (i.e., it will not appear in
the catalog).

I<url>

Not Documented

=head2 products.category.txt

The products.category.txt table (actually a link to products.txt.10)

=head1 HTML Hypertext links

Normally, regular hypertext links are not used in Interchange pages.
These kinds of links will not include the session ID. If the customer
follows an external link back to the catalog, the list of products
ordered so far will have been lost. The area tag is used to
generate a hypertext link which includes a session ID.

Instead of:

   <A HREF="/cgi-bin/mv/shirts">Shirts</A>

Use:

   <A HREF="[area shirts]">Shirts</A>

=head1 Images

Inline images are placed in Interchange pages in the normal fashion
with <IMG SRC="URL">. But since Interchange pages are served by a CGI
program, do not use relative links. The Foundation store defines an
image directory with the ImageDir and ImageDirSecure directives
that automatically adjusts the image path to a set base directory.

=head1 Browser Cookies

The Foundation store enables the Cookies directive so that users
with cookie-capable browsers will retain session context. Then,
standard HREF and Interchange page links can be intermixed without the
fear of losing the shopping basket. Cookie capability is also required
to use search caching, page caching, and statically generated pages.
If the user's browser does not support cookies, the cache will be
ignored.

If planning to use more than one host name within the same domain for
naming purposes (perhaps a secure server and non-secure server), set
the domain with the CookieDomain directive. This must contain at
least two periods (.) as per the cookie specification, and must be
located in the same server as the domain.

=head1 Dependencies in administration

In general, it's a good idea to leave fields empty if you don't want
to use them, instead of removing them from the database altogether.
That way nothing in admin or demo will break.
