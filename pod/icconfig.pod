=head1 NAME

Interchange Configuration

=head1 Interchange Configuration

Interchange is the industry's most widely distributed and implemented
open source e-commerce platform. This document provides detailed
configuration instructions for Interchange and the Construct Something
demo store demo included with the program, and answers a variety of
frequently asked questions. The Interchange program must be installed
before continuing. For more information on the Installation process,
see the Installation (icinstall) manual.

=head1 Creating a Catalog

Interchange uses unique tags to implement catalog functions. The tags
are similar to HTML, but the code is in C<[square brackets]>. The
Interchange tags will be referred to as either tags or elements in
this document.

There are multiple steps required to set up a custom Interchange
catalog. Refer to the Reference Tags (ictags) manual for more
information about Interchange tags and how they are used during
initial set up a catalog. The demo catalogs provide examples of these
tags and how they are used.

=head2 Create a Database

The first step is to develop a product database. This can contain all
of the information used to display product pages, or simply the
product code (SKU), a short description, and the price. At the
minimum, the product code, description, and price fields are required.

The following is a list of other elements that can be included:

=over 4

=item Image

A database field listing the name of an image file that displays the
product. Specify a name here, or omit this field from the database and
store images in files that are named for the product code. If using
images, they will be displayed by using the C<[if file file.gif] TAG
[/if]> construct).

=item Nontaxable

If the catalog contains any items that are non-taxable, use this field
to flag items that do not need to have sales tax calculated.

=item Size

A comma-separated string containing product size information, for
example:

Small, Medium, Large, XL

Other attribute information may be defined in a database field.

=item Weight

Used to enter the weight of products being shipped. This is useful for
UPS lookup or other weight-based shipping calculations.

=item Category

Used to select one-click category searches to build product
directories.

=item Related

Elements related to the item in the record. Using the Interchange
C<[loop item]> tag, product subclasses and accessory sets can be
built.

By default all database source files are located in the C<products>
subdirectory of the catalog directory. The main products database is
in the file C<products/products.txt> in the supplied demo catalogs.

If using one of the internal database methods, any changes made to the
ASCII source file will be reflected in the database in the next user
session. If the product database contains less than a thousand
records, updates will be instantaneous. If the product database is
substantially larger, updates will take longer. Use the C<NoImport>
reference tag to stop auto updating.

=head2 Features to Use

The Interchange demo catalog shows many features of Interchange, such
as list and category building, controlled search or query, random
selection of feature items, and templating with active elements.
However, each feature has its cost in complexity and performance.
Expect reduced performance if the computer has to do more for every
page it displays.

The following is a list of some popular features:

=over 4

=item Category Searches

If a catalog contains a small number of products, hard coded pages are
sufficient, though they can be more difficult to maintain compared to
database definitions. Regardless of the number of products in a
catalog, consider categorizing them so they can easily be found. Pick
a field in the database, perhaps named C<category>, and classify the
products for search using Interchange.

=item Images

Place a thumbnail image (perhaps with a link to a blowup) for the
items that have images. To do this, add an image field in the
database. Requiring file tests for every image in a large list can
degrade system performance.

=item Related Items

On a product's individual display page, embed searches of similar
products with the C<[query ...]> or C<[loop ...]> tags. Or, if
customer data is developed, search a past order database and display
products that would be of interest to that customer.

=item Reviews/Testimonials

Key the placement on the existence of a file in a certain directory.
This is reasonable to do when a user is viewing a single product.

=back

=head2 Use the Demo Catalogs

The demo catalogs supplied with Interchange are a starting point for
the creation of a custom catalog. They can be modified are-named, and
new icons can be added. Also, individual pages and the C<catalog.cfg>
file can be modified. Each demo catalog is independent, so
modifications made to one catalog will not effect others.

=head2 Tree design

Determine how users will enter and exit the catalog. Complex and
intelligent conditional schemes are possible, especially if the
Cookies capability is used. However, it is recommended that simplicity
be used. Consumers will not buy if they can't navigate their way
around the catalog.

It is important to remember that users will lose their session (and
items in their shopping cart) if their browser does not accept
cookies. Interchange addresses this problem by using of the C<area>
and C<page> tags. If using frames, source all frame panes containing
Interchange links from an initial page served by Interchange. If not,
the user may have multiple session IDs depending on which frame
generated the link. Note that Interchange does work properly even if
the browser doesn't store cookies. In this situation Interchange
inserts a session ID into each URL; if the ID is preserved as the user
navigates from page to page then the session will remain intact.

=head2 The Essentials

The rest of this section describes how to create a basic Interchange
catalog, one which displays pages and uses the demo shopping basket
and checkout sequence. If custom features are desired, like special
shipping charges and sales tax, more work is required. All of the
mentioned features (and more) are demonstrated in the C<simple> demo
catalog.

=head2 The Demo Catalog

Sample catalog pages are in the directory C<simple/>. If using these
sample pages as the starting point for a custom catalog, either have
the configure script install the demo automatically, or copy the files
into the Interchange directory and a unique HTML directory.

To install the demo and name it C<simple>:

bin/makecat simple

To install the demo and name it C<foo>:

bin/makecat foo

Answer the prompts supplied by the program. Note that there are two
types of paths requested: URL paths, like /cgi-bin inside
C<http://www.machine.com/cgi-bin/simple>, and file paths that are
complete fully-qualified file path names like
C</home/user/catalogs/simple> and C</home/httpd/cgi-bin>. Be prepared
to do some investigation to determine the proper paths for
installation.

=head2 More About "simple"

The C<simple> catalog really isn't. It is a full-featured
demonstration of Interchange capabilities, though not nearly all of
its features are used there. It uses the C<Variable> feature
extensively to simplify hand page editing. Basically speaking, a
C<Variable> is a define that permits the substitution of text for a
simple C<__VARIABLE__> string in a page.

For example, in the simple demo, this is a complete page with the
standard layout:

   __LOGOBAR__
   __MENUBAR__
   __LEFTSIDE__

       This is unique content.

   __RIGHTSIDE__
   __MENUBOTTOM__
   __COPYRIGHT__

The following illustration shows how this looks on the page.

   +--------------------------------------------------------+
   |   __LOGOBAR__                                          |
   |--------------------------------------------------------+
   |   __MENUBAR__                                          |
   |--------------+-------------------------+---------------+
   |              |                         |               |
   | __LEFTSIDE__ |   This is your content  | __RIGHTSIDE__ |
   |              |                         |               |
   |              |                         |               |
   +--------------+-------------------------+---------------+
   |   __MENUBOTTOM__                                       |
   |--------------------------------------------------------+
   |   __COPYRIGHT__                                        |
   +--------------------------------------------------------+

In HTML, the C<__RIGHTSIDE__> is simply defined to be empty, closing
the table row in most cases. The following illustration is actually
how the page looks.

   +--------------------------------------------------------+
   |   __LOGOBAR__                                          |
   |--------------------------------------------------------+
   |   __MENUBAR__                                          |
   |--------------+-----------------------------------------+
   |              |                                         |
   | __LEFTSIDE__ |   This is your content                  |
   |              |                                         |
   |              |                                         |
   +--------------+-----------------------------------------+
   |   __MENUBOTTOM__                                       |
   |--------------------------------------------------------+
   |   __COPYRIGHT__                                        |
   +--------------------------------------------------------+

The variables are defined in C<catalog.cfg>, and come from files in
the config directory. There are conditional templates with different
color schemes.

Once familiar with this method, it can be quite convenient. But other
methods may be chosen, such as using an HTML editor. Interchange can
coexist with editors that use the <NOTOUCH> </NOTOUCH> or <NOEDIT>
</NOEDIT> pairs to delimit information that should not be altered or
interpreted by the editor. Bear in mind that this templating method
and the database layout of the simple catalog is only a suggestion on
how a catalog might be organized. Many users decide to create their
own database structure for product display.

Yet, most users stick with the userdb and checkout strategies employed
in this catalog. This is because these strategies have been developed
and proven successful over a period of years. Still, they can be
customized to operate like Amazon.com or another site.

As stated previously, Interchange catalogs are all about the database.
The C<simple> demo has several tables:

=over 4

=item area

A table designed to implement a dynamic navigation bar. It is read and
parsed to display the areas C<Galleries>, C<Other Stuff>, and C<Links>
as distributed. Simply by changing the contents of the C<area> table,
the left side navigation bar can be modified. The value of the field
C<selector> is used to search the C<cat> table to find which
categories belong in each area.

=item cat

The product structure of C<simple> follows a single-level
categorization. Categories are listed in the C<cat> database table.
The C<cat> table is designed to allow the display of meta-information
about each category. The fields are:

=over 8

=item code

The category code. Must be unique.

=item area

Where the area in this category should be displayed.

=item selector

The selector that is used to scan the C<products> table for products
in the category.

=item name

A display label to replace C<code> or C<selector>.

=item banner_text

Text to display in a banner or heading.

=item subs

Placeholder in the demo that is intended to allow selection of certain
subcategories within the category.

=item sort

The sort order if an alphanumeric sort on C<name> is not desired.

=item url

A URL to link to instead of the default search in the products
database.

=back

=item country

A list of countries used to build select boxes and select shipping
modes based on countries.

=item inventory

Two fields: code and quantity. The Interchange demo will decrement the
quantity based on the sale. It is recommended that a field be added
with the usual shipping time of the product. For example, "ships
within 24 hours" or "Back ordered. Allow 2-4 weeks for delivery."

=item pricing

A database that works in conjunction with the C<CommonAdjust>
directive to allow quantity pricing, either for one product or for a
group of products (sometimes known as mix-and-match). The fields
C<q2,q5,q10,etc.> are for the quantity levels; the C<price_group>
field selects the mix-and-match category for the product.

=item products

The main product table. This is where product information is stored.
Add, delete, or ignore fields as desired. Field by field:

=over 8

=item sku

The unique identifier for the product. Though theoretically it can
contain most any character, use only characters of the class C<A-Z a-z
0-9 _ -> in order to be compatible with SQL databases, file systems,
and URL encoding. Other characters can cause problems. A slash (C</>)
can interfere with URLs and filenames. A colon (C<:>) can interfere
with database representations (or file names on some operating
systems). There are other possible compatibility situations with other
characters.

=item description

A short description for the product that is used for displaying in the
shopping cart, receipt, and order report. Keep it short.

=item title

This is usually catalog-specific since it applies to art. However, it
would also apply to books, CDs, or other items.

=item artist

This is usually catalog-specific since it applies to art. However, it
would also apply to CDs, or some other items. It can be changed as
long as the field names in the catalog pages are changed to match it.
Simply look for all occurrences of the string "artist" in the
C<pages>, C<special_pages>, and C<etc> directories.

=item comment

A long description of the product. If using the Interchange internal
database, the field size is unlimited; if using another type of
database, the length will be dependent on the field type selected.

=item display

Catalog-specific to show the museum where the art work is displayed.
This field can be used or deleted if not needed.

=item image

The image filename for the product. Many users add a C<thumb> field to
contain the name of a small image for search list display.

=item price

The quantity-one price of the product.

=item category

The category used for selection in lists. It is possible to place a
product in more than one category, although this will require
decisions about display and banner headings. Embedded Perl or other
methods can be used.

=item nontaxable

If set to C<1>, the product is not taxable and its price will not be
used in a sales tax calculation.

=item weight

A numeric value of the weight used for determining shipping costs.
Normally in pounds, it can be anything the shipping routines will
handle.

=item size

A comma-separated list of options as used in C<Accessories>. See the
C<flypage.html> and C<ord/basket.html> pages for examples of how it is
used.

=item color

A comma-separated list of options as used in C<Accessories>. See the
C<flypage.html> and C<ord/basket.html> pages for examples of how it is
used.

=item related

Used in the demo to display "upsells." This refers to opportunities to
purchase an additional item when this one is purchased. Contains a
comma-separated list of SKUs to be offered.

=item featured

As used in this demo, the only meaningful value is C<front>. If this
is contained in the field, this product may be featured on the front
page via random selection. See the C<index.html> page for how it
integrates with C<[loop search=something random=3]>.

=back

=item orderline

Every line item that is actually ordered is detailed in this table.
See the page C<query/check_orders.html> for how it might be used. See
C<etc/report> for how to add to it.

=item transactions

Each individual customer order is detailed in this table. See the page
C<query/check_orders.html> for how it might be used. See C<etc/report>
for how to add to it.

=item userdb

The user database used for maintaining customer address information,
account information, preferences, and more. See C<UserDB>.

=back

=head2 ITL - Interchange Tag Language

Interchange functions are accessed via ITL, the Interchange Tag
Language. The pages in the catalog are in HTML, but use ITL to provide
access to Interchange's functions. ITL tags are delimited by C<[square
brackets]> instead of angle brackets. They are usually called
Interchange tags or just tags. They are similar to HTML in syntax in
that there are both I<standalone> and I<container> tags. A standalone
tag has no ending element. For example:

   [value name]

This tag inserts the user's name, providing it has been provided in a
form. A container tag has both a beginning and an ending element. For
example:

   [if value name]
   You have a name.
   [/if]

These tags perform various display and data modification operations
for the user session. There are over 80 standard predefined tags; the
C<UserTag> facility permits the creation of new tags to perform
user-defined functions. The user tags can be every bit as powerful as
the standard tags.

As an introduction, a few of the tag names and their general function
follow:

 [accessories]     Access product accessory functions
[area]            Insert a re-written Interchange URL
[catch]
  [/catch]
[checked]         Conditionally check an HTML check/radio box
[currency]        Formats a number as currency for current locale
  [/currency]
[data]            Access a database or user session element
[error]           Check/display form processing errors
[file]            Insert the contents of a file
[flag]            Set an Interchange flag
[fly-list]        Show an item "on-the-fly" in an arbitrary page
  [/fly-list]
[fly-tax]                 Builds a tax rate
[html_table]      Create an HTML table from a query or list
[include]         Include a file with complete Interchange interpretation
[item-list]       Iterate over a shopping cart
  [/item-list]
[label]           Set a label for goto
[loop]            Iterate over an arbitrary list
  [/loop]
[mvasp]           ASP-style Perl programming area
[no-match]        Define area of region results displayed when no match
  [/no-match]
[nitems]          Show number of items for a shopping cart
[order]           Create HTML link to order an item
[page]            Create A HREF with re-written URL to call Interchange page
[perl]            Embed output of arbitrary Perl in the page
  [/perl]
[price]           Show price of an item
[process]         Create URL for Interchange form processing
[query]           Perform any of several types of SQL query
  [/query]
[record]          Set a database record
[region]          Define an area of the page as a search list/query

  [/search-list]
[selected]        Conditional selection of drop-down <SELECT ...>
[set]             Set a scratch variable
  [/set]

[try]
  [/try]
[userdb]          Access user database functions
[value]           Display form value
[value_extended]  Display form array values or do file upload functions

A complete list of tags and all tag syntax is available in the ictags
document.

=head2 HTML Hypertext links

Normally, regular hypertext links are not used in Interchange pages.
These kinds of links will not include the session ID. If the customer
follows an external link back to the catalog, the list of products
ordered so far will have been lost. The C<area> tag is used to
generate a hypertext link which includes a session ID.

Instead of:

   <A HREF="/cgi-bin/mv/shirts">Shirts</A>

Use:

   <A HREF="[area shirts]">Shirts</A>

=head2 Images

Inline images are placed in Interchange pages in the normal fashion
with <IMG SRC="URL">. But since Interchange pages are served by a CGI
program, do not use relative links. Interchange has the capability of
defining an image directory (with the C<ImageDir> and
C<ImageDirSecure> directives) that automatically adjusts the image
path to a set base directory.

=head2 Browser Cookies

Enable the C<Cookies> directive so that users with cookie-capable
browsers will retain session context. Then, standard HREF and
Interchange page links can be intermixed without fear of losing the
shopping basket. Cookie capability is also required to use search
caching, page caching, and statically generated pages. If the user's
browser does not support cookies, the cache will be ignored.

If planning to use more than one host name within the same domain for
naming purposes (perhaps a secure server and non-secure server), set
the domain with the C<CookieDomain> directive. This must contain at
least two periods (.) as per the cookie specification, and must be
located in the same server as the domain.

=head2 Basic Interchange Tags

B<Note: >In the descriptions that follow, parameters marked with an
asterisk (*) are optional. When a tag is separated by an underscore,
as in C<item_list>, a dash is just as appropriate (i.e.,
C<item-list>). They are interchangeable, except that the ending tag
and beginning tag should match (don't use C<[item-list] list
[/item_list]>). B<*> I<indicates an optional argument>

=head2 Inserting Hyperlinks

=over 4

=item

Named parameters: [area href="dir/page" secure=1* arg="argument"*
form="form string"*]

Positional parameters: [area pg arg*]

Produces the URL to call an Interchange page, without the surrounding
C<A HREF> notation. This can be used to get control of HREF items,
perhaps to place an ALT string or a JavaScript construct. It was
originally named C<area> because it also can be used in a client-side
image map.

       <A HREF="[area catalog]" ALT="Main catalog page">

The optional arg is used just as in the page tag.

The optional C<form> argument is used to encode a form in the link.

       <A HREF="[area                mv_order_item=99-102
               mv_order_size=L
               mv_order_quantity=1
               mv_separate_items=1
               mv_todo=refresh"
       ]"> Order t-shirt in Large size </A>

orm="

See above for more information.

=back

=over 4

=item [/page], [/order]

Expands into </a>. Used with the page element, such as:

    [page shirts]Our shirt collection[/page].

=back

B<TIP: >A small efficiency boost in large pages is to just use the
</A> tag.

=over 4

=item [page ...]

Named parameters: C<[page href="dir/page" arg="argument" secure=1*
form="form string"]>

Positional parameters: C<[page dir/page arg*] (only two positional
parameters)>

Insert a hyperlink to the specified catalog page pg. For example,
[page shirts] will expand into <a
href="http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink/shirts?id=WehUkATn&pc=33">.
The catalog page displayed will come from "shirts.html" in the pages
directory.

If the user has sent a cookie to Interchange (meaning the second page
they access), and the scratch value C<mv_no_session_id> is set in
their session, the session ID will not be appended to the URL. If the
scratch value C<mv_no_count> is set, then the page count will not be
appended. This is not dependent on cookies. So, if placed in the
initial page:

    [set mv_no_session_id]1    [set mv_no_count]1[/set]
    [set mv_add_dot_html]1[/set]

/set]

or put in C<catalog.cfg>:

    ScratchDefault  mv_no_session    ScratchDefault  mv_no_count       1
    ScratchDefault  mv_add_dot_html   1

id  1

No session ID or count will be shown. That makes the URL shown above
to be http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink/shirts.html. Once
again, this is on the second page the user accesses, if they are
taking and sending cookies. If the user has a pre-existing
C<MV_SESSION_ID> or C<MV_USERNAME> cookie from a prior session, the
effect will be immediate.

The C<argument> will be passed to Interchange and placed in the
C<mv_arg> session parameter. This allows programming of a conditional
page display based on where the link came from. The argument is then
available with the tag [data session arg], or the embedded Perl
session variable $Session->{arg}. Spaces and some other characters
will be escaped with the %NN URL-style notation and unescaped when the
argument is read back into the session.

A bit of magic occurs if Interchange has built a static plain HTML
page for the target page. Instead of generating a normal
Interchange-parsed page reference, a static page reference will be
inserted if the user has accepted and sent back a cookie with the
session ID.

The optional C<form> argument allows for encoding a form in the link.

        [page                 mv_order_item=99-102
                mv_order_size=L
                mv_order_quantity=1
                mv_separate_items=1
                mv_todo=refresh"] Order t-shirt in Large size </A>

orm="

The two form values C<mv_session_id> and C<mv_arg> are automatically
added when appropriate. (mv_arg is the C<arg> parameter for the tag.)

If the parameter C<href> is not supplied, process is used, causing
normal Interchange form processing. If the C<href> points to an
http://link no Interchange URL processing will be done, but the
C<mv_session_id>. This would generate a form that ordered item number
99-102 on a separate line (C<mv_separate_items> being set), with size
C<L>, in quantity 2. Since the page is not set, the user will go to
the default shopping cart page.

At the same time, C<mv_orderpage=yourpage> could be set to go to
C<yourpage>.  Theoretically, any form can be submitted with this,
though none of the included values can have newlines or trailing
whitespace. To do so requires the writing of a UserTag. Foreign forms
can also be submitted, but they will not touch the href if it begins
with http:, ftp:, or the like.

=item [/page], [/order]

Expands into </a>. Used with the page element, such as:

  [page shirts]Our shirt collection[/page].

\TIP: A small efficiency boost in large pages is to just use the </A>
tag.

=back

=head2 How to Order an Item

Interchange can either use a form-based order or a link-based order to
place an item in the shopping cart. The link-based order uses the
special C<[order item-code]> tag:

=over 4

=item [order code]

Named parameters:

        [order code="sku" href="page" cart="cartname"* base="table"]

Expands into a hypertext link which will include the specified code in
the list of products to order and display the order page. C<Code>
should be a product SKU listed in one of the "products" tables. The
optional argument C<cart/page> selects the shopping cart where the
item will be placed (begin with / to use the default cart C<main>) and
the order page that will display the order. The optional argument base
constrains the order to a particular products file. If not specified,
all tables defined as products files will be searched in sequence for
the item.

Example:

Order a [order TK112]Toaster[/order] today.

Note that this is the same as:

Order a [page order TK112]Toaster</A> today.

You can change frames for the order with:

Order a <A HREF="[area order TK112]" TARGET=newframe>Toaster</A> today.

=item [/order]

Expands into </a>. Used with the order element, such as: Buy a
C<[order TK112]>ToasterC<[/order]> today.

=back

To order with a form, you set the form variable C<mv_order_item> to
the item-code/SKU and use the C<refresh> action:

 <FORM ACTION="[process-target]"<INPUT TYPE=hidden  NAME="mv_todo"        VALUE="refresh">
<INPUT TYPE=hidden  NAME="mv_order_item"  VALUE="TK112">

Order <INPUT NAME="mv_order_quantity" SIZE=3 VALUE=1> toaster

<INPUT TYPE=submit VALUE="Order!">
</FORM>

METHOD=POST>

Groups of items may be batched:

 <FORM ACTION="[process-target]"<INPUT TYPE=hidden  NAME="mv_todo"        VALUE="refresh">

<INPUT TYPE=hidden  NAME="mv_order_item"  VALUE="TK112">
<INPUT NAME="mv_order_quantity" SIZE=3> Standard Toaster

<INPUT TYPE=hidden  NAME="mv_order_item"  VALUE="TK200">
<INPUT NAME="mv_order_quantity" SIZE=3> Super Toaster

<INPUT TYPE=submit VALUE="Order!">
</FORM>

METHOD=POST>

Items that have a quantity of zero (or blank) will be skipped. Only
items with a positive quantity will be placed in the basket.

Attributes like size or color may be specified at time of order. Order
the T-shirt from the more details page of the C<simple> demo to see
how it is done.

=head2 Accessing Form Values

When a form is sent to Interchange, the program reads the values and
places them in the user session. The following form:

 <FORM ACTION="[area index]"<INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=mv_action VALUE=return>
<INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=foo VALUE=bar>
<INPUT TYPE=submit NAME="Make foo=bar">
</FORM>

METHOD=POST>

will make the C<[value foo]> tag equal to C<bar> on the next page,
then, send you to the page C<index>(.html). Same for this link:

 <A HREF="[are                    form='
                      foo=bar
                      mv_action=return
                    ']">Make foo=bar</A>

  href==item [value name=field set="new value" filter="filter" hide=1]

\Positional:  C<[value varname]>

The C<[value ...]> ITL tag expands into the current value of the
customer/form input field named by field. If the C<set> value is
present, the form variable value will be set to it and the new value
returned. Use this to "uncheck" a checkbox or set other form variable
values to defaults. If C<HIDE> is set, the value will be set but not
returned to the page.

The C<filter="filter1 filter1"> parameter applies any of the standard
Interchange filter types to the value. See C<Filters>. When the value
is returned, any Interchange tags present in the value will be
escaped. This prevents users from entering Interchange tags in form
values, which could be a serious security risk.

index

=head2 The Catalog Directory

Interchange pages are NOT in normal HTML space. They are contained in
the catalog directory. Each individual catalog must have its own base
directory. The catalog directory has the following structure by
default:

=over 4

=item catalog.cfg

File containing configuration directives for this catalog.
(Subcatalogs have differing information in a file named for the
subcatalog.)

=item config

Directory that will be read when directives are set with the
C<filename> notation. For example, the file C<config/static.pages>
will be read when the following directive is encountered in the
C<catalog.cfg> file.

  StaticPage  <static.pages

This directory also contains template information used with the
C<makecat> program.

=item error.log

File which contains catalog-specific errors. It is also where any
syntax errors in embedded Perl code will be shown.

=item etc

Directory normally used for tracking files, order profiles, and other
configuration and log information.

=item pages

Directory that contains the pages of the catalog. This can be
considered to be the "document root" of the catalog. Pages contained
therein are called with the path information after the script name.
For example:

/cgi-bin/simple/products/gold will call the page in thpages/products/gold.html.

 file

=item products

Directory containing database source files, including the special
Interchange databases shipping.asc, pricing.asc (and other shipping
database files).

=item session

Directory which contains session files.

=item tmp

The temporary or scratch directory for various uses like retired ID
numbers, search paging files, sort tests, import temporary files, etc.
This is the default set by ScratchDir. It can be redefined to be
located on another partition.

=back

=head2 Setting Up Multiple Catalogs

Interchange has multiple catalog capability, and therefore breaks the
configuration files into two pieces. One is global
(C<interchange.cfg>) and affects every catalog running under it. The
other (C<catalog.cfg>) is specific to an individual catalog, and has
no effect on other catalogs.

The global C<interchange.cfg> file is located in the main Interchange
directory, and has only a few server-wide configuration parameters.
The most important is the Catalog directive, which defines the
catalogs will be created at server startup. The Catalog directive is
often set up by the C<makecat> program, which can be used to configure
a catalog.

Here is an example C<Catalog> directive:

Catalog simple /home/catalogs/simple /cgi-bin/simple
/secure-bin/simple

=over 4

=item simple

The catalog identifier, used as the name of the catalog on command
lines. In the supplied demo configuration this would be C<simple>. The
identifier can contain characters from the set [B<A-Za-z0-9_>].

=item /home/catalogs/simple

The directory where the catalog.cfg file may be found, and usually the
directory where pages and databases are kept.

=item /cgi-bin/simple  /secure-bin/simple

The script names which, when containing an Interchange link program,
will cause that catalog to be called. At least one must be supplied,
and the same name may not be used for more than one catalog unless the
C<FullURL> directive is specified. In this case, the parameter may be
specified as:

www.yourcompany.com/cgi-bin/swww.theirs.com/cgi-bin/simple may call a different catalog.

mple;

=back

=head1 Internationalization

Interchange has a rich set of internationalization (I18N) features to
allow conditional message display, differing price formats, different
currency definitions, price factoring, sorting, and other settings.
The definitions are maintained in the catalog.cfg file through the use
of built-in POSIX support and Interchange's C<Locale> directive. All
settings are independent for each catalog and each user of that
catalog. Customers can access the same catalog in an unlimited number
of languages and currencies.

=head2 Setting the Locale

The locale could be set to C<fr_FR> (French for France) in one of two
ways:

=over 4

=item [setlocale locale=locale* currency=locale* persist=1*]

This tag is for new-style tags only and will not work for C<[old]>.

Immediately sets the locale to C<locale>, and will cause it to persist
in future user pages if the C<persist> is set to a non-zero, non-blank
value. If the C<currency> attribute is set, the pricing and
currency-specific locale keys and Interchange configuration directives
are modified to that locale. If there are no arguments, it sets it
back to the user's default locale as defined in the scratch variables
C<mv_locale> and C<mv_currency>.

This allows:

    Dollar Pr
    [setlocale en_US]
    [item-list]
    [item-code]: [item-price]<BR>
    [/item-list]

    Franc Pricing:

    [setlocale fr_FR]
    [item-list]
    [item-code]: [item-price]<BR>
    [/item-list]

    [comment] Return to the user's default locale [/comment]
    [setlocale]

cing:

=item [page process/locale/fr_FR/page/catalog]

This is the same as C<[page catalog]>, except when the link is
followed it will set the locale to C<fr_FR> before displaying the
page. This is persistent.

=item [page process/locale/fr_FR/currency/en_US/page/catalog]

This is the same as C<[page catalog]>, except when the link is
followed it will set the locale to C<fr_FR> and the pricing/number
display to the locale C<en_US> before displaying the page. This is
persistent.

=back

Once the locale is persistently set for a user, it is in effect for
the duration of their session.

=head2 Interchange Locale Settings

The C<Locale> directive has many possible settings allowing complete
internationalization of page sets and currencies. The C<Locale>
directive is defined in a series of key/value pairs with a key (which
contains word characters only) followed by a value. The value should
be surrounded by double quotes if it contains whitespace. In this
example, the key is C<Value setting>.

   Locale fr_FR "Value setting" "Configuration de valeur"
   Locale de_DE "Value setting" Werteinstellung

When accessed via the special tag C<[L]Value setting[/L]>, the value
C<Configuration de valeur> will be displayed B<only> if the locale is
set to C<fr_FR>. If the locale is set to C<de_DE>, the string
C<Werteinstellung> will be displayed. If it is neither, the default
value of C<Value setting> will be displayed.

The C<[L]> and C<[/L]> must be capitalized. This is done for speed of
processing as well as easy differentiation in text.

Another, perhaps better, way to do this is right in the page. The
C<[LC]> ... C<[/LC]> pragma pair permits specification of
locale-dependent text.

 [LC]
           This is the default text.
   [fr_FR] Text for the fr_FR locale. [/fr_FR]
   [de_DE] Text for the de_DE locale. [/de_DE]
 [/LC]

Or place an entire new page in place of the default one if the locale
key is defined. When locale is in force, and a key named C<HTMLsuffix>
is set to the locale, Interchange first looks for a page with a suffix
corresponding to the locale. For example:

<A HREF="[area index]">Catalog home page</A>

If a page index.html exists, it will be the default. If the current
locale is C<fr_FR>, a page "index.fr_FR" exists, and C<Locale> looks
like this:

   Locale fr_FR HTMLsuffix  fr_FR

Then, the C<.fr_FR> page will be used instead of the C<.html> page.
For longer series of strings, the configuration file recognizes:

   Locale fr_FR <<EOF
   {
       "Value setting",
       "Configuration de valeur",

       "Search",
       "Recherche"
   }
   EOF

The above sets two string substitutions. As long as this is valid Perl
syntax describing a series of settings, the text will be matched. It
can contain any arbitrary set of characters that don't contain C<[L]>
and C<[/L]>. If using double quotes, string literals like \n and \t
are recognized.

A database can also be used to set locale information. It can be added
to any database in the C<catalog.cfg> file, and values in it will
overwrite previous settings. See I<LocaleDatabase>. The C<[L]default
text[/L]> is set before any other page processing. It is equivalent to
the characters "default text" or the appropriate C<Locale> translation
for all intents and purposes. Interchange tags and Variable values can
be embedded.

Since the C<[L] message [/L]> substitution is done before any tag
processing, the command C<[L][item-data table field][/L]> will fail.
There is an add-on C<[loc] message [/loc]> I<UserTag> supplied with
the distribution beginning at V3.09. It does the same thing as C<[L]
[/L]> except after all tag substitution is done. See
<interchange.cfg.dist> for the definition.

Care is required when editing pages with localization information.
Changing even one character of the message will change the key value
and invalidate the message for other languages. To prevent this, use:

   [L key]The default.[/L]

The key C<msg_key> will then be used to index the message. This may be
preferable for many applications.

A C<localize> script is included with Interchange. It will parse files
included on the command line and produce output that can be easily
edited to produce localized information. Given an existing file, it
will merge new information where appropriate.

=head2 Special Locale Keys for Price Representation

Interchange honors the standard POSIX keys:

   mon_decimal_point decimal_point
   mon_thousands_sep thousands_sep
   currency_symbol   int_currency_symbol
   frac_digits       p_cs_precedes

See the POSIX setlocale(3) man page for more information. These will
be used for formatting prices and will approximate the number format
used in most countries. To set the price format to a custom format,
use these special keys:

=over 4

=item price_picture

Interchange will format a currency number based on a "picture" given
to it. The basic form is:

    Locale en_US price_picture "$ ###,###,###.##"

This is locale C<en_US>, the United States, and it would display
C<4452.3> as C<$ 4,452.30>. The same display can be achieved with:

     Locale en_US mon_thousands     Locale en_US mon_decimal_point .
     Locale en_US p_cs_precedes     1
     Locale en_US currency_symbol   $

sep ,

A common price_picture for European countries would be
C<###.###.###,##>, which would display the same number as C<4.452,30>.
To add a franc notation at the end for the locale C<fr_FR>, use the
setting:

    Locale fr_FR price_picture "##.###,## fr"

=back

B<IMPORTANT NOTE: >The decimal point in use, set by
C<mon_decimal_point>, and the thousands separator, set by
C<mon_thousands_sep> must match the settings in the picture. The
C<frac_digits> setting is not used in this case. It is derived from
the location of the decimal (if any).

=over 4

=item

The same setting for C<fr_FR> above can be achieved with:

     Locale fr_FR mon_thousands     Locale fr_FR mon_decimal_point ,
     Locale fr_FR p_cs_precedes     0
     Locale fr_FR currency_symbol   fr

sep .

If the number of digits is greater than the # locations in the
picture, the digits will be changed to asterisks. An overflow number
above would show as C<**.***,** fr>.

=back

=over 4

=item picture

Same as C<price_picture>, but sets the value returned if the
C<[currency]> tag is not used. If the number of digits is greater than
the # locations in the picture, the digits will be changed to
asterisks, displaying something like C<**,***.**>.

=back

=head2 Dynamic Locale Directive Changes

If Locale keys are set to correspond to some Interchange
C<catalog.cfg> directives, those values will be set when setting the
locale.

=over 4

=item PageDir

To use a different page directory for different locales, set the
C<PageDir> key. To have two separate language page sets, French and
English, set:

    # Establish the default at s    PageDir   english
    Locale fr_FR  PageDir  francais
    Locale en_US  PageDir  english

artup

=item ImageDir

To use a different image directory for different locales, set the
C<ImageDir> key. To have two separate language button sets, French and
English, set:

    # Establish the default at s    ImageDir   /images/english/
    Locale fr_FR  ImageDir   /images/francais/
    Locale en_US  ImageDir   /images/english/

artup

=item ImageDirSecure

Same as ImageDir.

=item PriceField

To use a different field in the products database for pricing based on
locale, set the C<PriceField> locale setting.

    # Establish the default at s    PriceField    price
    Locale fr_FR  PriceField  prix

artup

The default will always be C<price>, but if the locale C<fr_FR> is
set, the C<PriceField> directive will change to C<prix> to give prices
in francs instead of dollars.

If C<PriceBreaks> is enabled, the field C<prix> from the C<pricing>
database will be used to develop the quantity pricing. NOTE: If no
C<Locale> settings are present, it will always be C<price>, regardless
of the C<PriceField> setting. Otherwise, it will always match
C<PriceField>.

=item PriceDivide

Normally used to enable penny pricing with a setting of 100, this can
be used to do an automatic conversion factor based on locale.

    # Default at startup is 1 if n    # Franc is strong these days!
    Locale fr_FR  PriceDivide  .20

t set

The price will now be divided by C<.20>, yielding franc prices five
times that of the dollar.

=item PriceCommas

This controls whether the C<mon_thousands_sep> will be used for
standard currency formatting. Ignored if using C<price_picture>. Set
to 1 or 0, to enable and disable respectively. DO NOT USE Yes and No.

    # Default at startup is Yes if n    PriceCommas  Yes
    Locale fr_FR  PriceCommas  0
    Locale en_US  PriceCommas  1

t set

=item UseModifier

Changes the fields from the set shopping cart options.

    # Default at startup is 1 if n    # Franc is strong these days!
    UseModifier format
    Locale fr_FR  UseModifier formats

t set

If a previous setting was made for an item based on another locale, it
will be maintained.

=item PriceAdjustment

Changes the fields from C<UseModifier> that will be used to adjust
pricing to an automatic conversion factor based on locale.

    # Default at s    PriceAdjustment  format
    Locale fr_FR  PriceAdjustment  formats

artup

=item TaxShipping,SalesTax

Same as the standard directives.

=item DescriptionField

This changes the field accessed by default with the
C<[item-description]> and C<[description code]> tags.

    # Establish the default at s    DescriptionField    description
    Locale fr_FR  DescriptionField desc_fr

artup

=item The [locale] tag

Standard error messages can be set based on Locale settings. Make sure
not to use any of the predefined keys. It is safer to begin a key with
msg_ or such. The default message is set between the C<[locale key]>
and C<[/locale]> tags. See the example above.

=back

=head2 Sorting Based on Locale

The Interchange C<[sort database:field]> keys will use the LC_COLLATE
setting for a locale provided that:

=over 4

=item *

The operating system and C compiler support locales for POSIX, and
have the locale definitions set.

=item *

The locale setting matches any configured locales.

=back

It is beyond the scope of this document to discuss these issues.
Contact your system administrator or local wizard for help setting up
locales on your system.

If this arbitrary database named C<letters>:

   code        letter
   00-0011     f
   99-102      é
   19-202      a

and this loop:

   [loop 19-202 00-0011 99-102]
   [sort letters:letter]
   [loop-data letters letter]   [loop-code]
   [/loop]

used the default C setting for LC_COLLATE, it would display:

   a  19-202
   f  00-0011
   é  99-102

If the proper LC_COLLATE settings for locale C<fr_FR> were in effect,
then it would become:

   a  19-202
   é  99-102
   f  00-0011

=head2 Placing Locale Information in a Database

Interchange has the capability to read its locale information from a
database, named with the C<LocaleDatabase> directive. The database can
be of any valid Interchange type. The locales are in columns, and the
keys are in rows. For example, to set up price information:

   key                 en_US   fr_FR   de_DE
   PriceDivide         1       .1590   .58
   mon_decimal_point   .       ,       ,
   mon_thousands_sep   ,       .
   currency_symbol     $        frs    DM
   ps_cs_precedes      1       0       0

This would translate I<exactly> into:

   Locale en_US PriceDivide         1
   Locale en_US mon_decimal_point   .
   Locale en_US mon_thousands_sep   ,
   Locale en_US currency_symbol     $
   Locale en_US ps_cs_precedes      1

   Locale fr_FR PriceDivide         .1590
   Locale fr_FR mon_decimal_point   ,
   Locale fr_FR mon_thousands_sep   .
   Locale fr_FR currency_symbol     " frs"
   Locale fr_FR ps_cs_precedes      0

   Locale de_DE PriceDivide         .58
   Locale de_DE mon_decimal_point   ,
   Locale de_DE mon_thousands_sep   " "
   Locale de_DE currency_symbol     "DM "
   Locale de_DE ps_cs_precedes      1

These settings append and overwrite any that are set in the catalog
configuration files, including any include files. Important note: This
information is only read during catalog configuration. It is not
reasonable to access a database for translation or currency conversion
in the normal course of events.

=head1 Programming

Interchange has a powerful paradigm for extending and enhancing its
functionality. It uses two mechanisms, user-defined tags and user
subroutines on two different security levels, global and catalog. In
addition, C<Embedded Perl Code> may be used to build functionality
into pages.

User-defined tags are defined with the UserTag directive in either
C<interchange.cfg> or C<catalog.cfg>. The tags in C<interchange.cfg>
are global, i.e., they are not constrained by the C<Safe> Perl module
as to which opcodes and routines they may use. Normally, the
user-defined tags in C<catalog.cfg> are constrained by C<Safe>, but if
the C<AllowGlobal> global directive is set for the particular catalog
in use, its UserTag and C<Sub> definitions will have global
capability.

Many of the internal Interchange routines can be accessed by the savvy
programmer who reads the source and finds the entry points. Also, many
internal Interchange routines can be overridden:

   GlobalSub <<EOS
   sub just_for_overriding {
       package Vend::Module;
       use MyModule;
       sub to_override {
           &MyModule::do_something_funky($Values->{my_variable});
       }
   }
   EOS

The effect of the above is to override the C<to_override> routine in
the module C<Vend::Module>. This is preferable to hacking the code for
functionality changes that are not expected to change frequently. In
most cases, updating the Interchange code will not affect the hacked
code. Note that internal entry points are not guaranteed to exist in
future versions of Interchange.

=head2 Embedded Perl Code

Perl code can be directly embedded in Interchange pages. The code is
specified as:

   [perl]
       $name    = $Values->{name};
       $browser = $Session->{browser};
       return "Hi, $name! How do you like your $browser?";
   [/perl]

ASP syntax can be used with:

   [mvasp]
       <%
       $name    = $Values->{name};
       $browser = $Session->{browser};
       %>
       Hi, <%= $name %>!
       <%
           HTML "How do you like your $browser?";
       %>
   [/mvasp]

The two snippets above are essentially equivalent.

The C<[perl]> tag enforces C<Safe.pm> checking, and many standard Perl
operators are not available. This prevents user access to all files
and programs on the system without the Interchange daemon's
permissions. See C<GlobalSub> and C<UserTag> for ways to make external
files and programs available to Interchange.

=over 4

=item

Named parameters:

   [perl tables="tables-to-open"* subs=1 global=1* no_return=1*]

=back

=over 4

=item

Required parameters: none

Parameter information:

=over 8

=item global

When set to C<1>, and when the catalog is allowed to use global
permissions via the C<interchange.cfg> directive C<AllowGlobal>,
Safe.pm checking is turned off. In this case, the embedded Perl code
can do anything that the user ID running it can! This is not
recommended when a single Interchange server is shared by multiple
companies/user ids.

When in global mode, full C<use strict> checking is on. Optionally, it
can be turned off with C<no strict;>. In fact, this is recommended
since strict errors will cause silent failure.

=item subs

When set to C<1>, any C<GlobalSub> routines can be accessed by name.

=item tables

Opens specified Interchange database tables, preparing them for access
inside the Perl code.

When running under C<Safe>, some database operations are restricted
due to the inability to create objects in this mode. For SQL, most
operations can be performed if the C<Safe::Hole> module is installed.
Otherwise, use C<global> to use data from SQL tables. Interchange
databases can be accessed as long as they are pre-opened by using an
item first.

=back

Example:

    [perl tables="products pri        $key = $Values->{sku};
        $title = $Tag->data('products', 'title', $key):
        return "You looked up the title $title";
    [/perl]

ing"]

If the tables=products> was not specified, there would be a syntax
error trap from C<Safe.pm>.

=back

Any Interchange tag (except ones using SQL) can be accessed via the
C<$Tag> object. If using SQL queries inside a Perl element,
C<AllowGlobal> permissions are required and and the C<global=1>
parameter must be set. Installing the module C<Safe::Hole> along with
sharing the database table with <tables=tablename> will enable SQL
use.

=over 4

=item

Examples:

   # If the item might contain a single   [perl]
   $comments = $Values->{comments};
   [/perl]

quote

=back

B<IMPORTANT NOTE: >Global subroutines are not subject to the stringent
security checking of the C<Safe> module, so almost anything goes
there. The subroutine will be able to modify any variable in
Interchange, and will be able to write to read and write any file that
the Interchange daemon has permission to write. Though this gives
greater power, it should be used with caution. They are defined in the
main C<interchange.cfg> file, so should be safe from individual users
in a multi-catalog system.

Global subroutines are defined in C<interchange.cfg> with the
C<GlobalSub> directive, or in user catalogs which have been enabled
via C<AllowGlobal>. Catalog subroutines are defined in C<catalog.cfg>,
with the C<Sub> directive. They are subject to the stringent Safe.pm
security restrictions that are controlled by the global directive
C<SafeUntrap>.

The code can be as complex as desired, but cannot use any operators
that modify the file system or use "unsafe" operations like "system,"
"exec," or backticks. These constraints are enforced with the default
permissions of the standard Perl module Safe. Operations may be
untrapped on a system-wide basis with the C<SafeUntrap> directive.

The result of this tag will be the result of the last expression
evaluated, just as in a subroutine. If there is a syntax error or
other problem with the code, there will be no output.

Here is a simple one which does the equivalent of the classic hello.pl
program:

   [perl] my $tmp = "Hello, world!"; $tmp; [/perl]

Of course, there is no need to set the variable. It is there just to
show the capability.

To echo the user's browser, but within some HTML tags:

   [perl]
   my $html = '<H5>';
   $html .= $Session->{browser};
   $html .= '</H5>';
   $html;
   [/perl]

To show the user their name and the current time:

   [perl arg=values]

   my $string = "Hi, " . $Values->{name} ". The time is now ";
   $string .= $Tag->time();
   $string;

   [/perl]

=head2 ASP-Like Perl

Interchange supports an ASP-like syntax using the C<mvasp> tag.

   [mvasp]
   <HTML><BODY>
       This is HTML.<BR>

   <% HTML "This is code<BR>"; %>
       More HTML.<BR>
   <% $Document->write("Code again.<BR>") %>
   [/mvasp]

If no closing C<[/mvasp]> tag is present, the remainder of the page
will be seen as ASP.

ASP is simple. Anything between <% and %> is code, and the string %>
is not allowed anywhere inside. Anything not between those anchors is
plain HTML that will be placed unchanged on the page. Interchange
variables and [L][/L] and [LC][/LC] areas will still be inserted, but
any Interchange tags will not.

There is a shorthand <% = $foo %>, which is exactly equivalent to <%
$Document->write($foo); %> or <% HTML $foo; %>

   [mvasp]
   <HTML><BODY>
       This is HTML.<BR>
       [value name] will show up as &#91;value name].<BR>

       &#95_VARIABLE__ value is equal to: __VARIABLE__

   <% = "This is code<BR>" %>

The C<__VARIABLE__> will be replaced by the value of C<Variable
VARIABLE>, but [value name] will be shown unchanged.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If using the C<SQL::Statement> module, the catalog
must be set to C<AllowGlobal> in C<interchange.cfg>. It will not work
in "Safe" mode due to limitations of object creation in Safe. Also,
the C<Safe::Hole> module must be installed to have SQL databases work
in Safe mode.

=head1 Interchange Perl Objects

Interchange gives ready access to all objects associated with the
catalog and the user settings, with opcode restrictions based on the
standard Perl module C<Safe.pm>. There are some unique things to know
about programming with Interchange.

Under C<Safe>, certain things cannot be used. For instance, this is
not legal when running Safe:

   $variable = `cat file/contents`;

The backtick operator violates a number of the default Safe opcode
restrictions. Direct file opens are not allowed, either:

   open(SOMETHING, "something.txt")
       or die;

This will also cause a trap, and the code will fail to compile.
However, Interchange equivalent routines can be used:

   # This will work if your administrator doesn't have NoAbsolute set
   $users = $Tag->file('/home/you/list');

   # This will always work, file names are based in the catalog directory
   $users = $Tag->file('userlist');

The standard objects are:

=over 4

=item $CGI

This is a hash reference to C<%CGI::values>, the value of user
variables as submitted in the current page/form. To get the value of a
variable submitted as

    <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=foo VALUE=bar>

use

    <% $Document->write("Value of foo is $CGI->{foo}"); %>

Remember, multiple settings of the same variable are separated by a
NULL character. To get the array value, use $CGI_array.

=item $CGI_array

This is a hash reference to C<%CGI::values_array>, arrays containing
the value or values of user variables as submitted in the current
page/form. To get the value of a variable submitted as

    <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=foo VALUE=    <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=foo VALUE='baz'>

bar'>

use

    <% = "The values of foo are", join (' and ', @{$CGI_array->{'foo'}}) %>

Remember, multiple settings of the same variable are separated by a
NULL character. To get the array value, use $CGI_array.

=item $Carts

A reference to the shopping cart hash $Vend::Session->{carts}. The
normal default cart is "main". An alias is $Items in the normal course
of events.

Shopping carts are an array of hash references. Here is an example of
a session cart array containing a C<main> and a C<layaway> cart.
        'main' => [
                    {
                        'code' => '00-0011',
                        'mv_ib' => 'products',
                        'quantity' => 1,
                        'size' => undef,
                        'color' => undef
                    },
                    {
                        'code' => '99-102',
                        'mv_ib' => 'products',
                        'quantity' => 2,
                        'size' => 'L',
                        'color' => 'BLUE'
                    }
                ],
        'layaway' => [
                    {
                        'code' => '00-341',
                        'mv_ib' => 'products',
                        'quantity' => 1,
                        'size' => undef,
                        'color' => undef
                    }
                ]
    }

    {

In this cart array, $Carts->{main}[1]{code} is equal to C<99-102>. In
the normal course of events, it would be equivalent to
$Items->[1]{code}.

=item $Config

A reference to the $Vend::Cfg array. Normally use this with a liberal
dose of the Interchange source code, but for simple things use
something like:

    # Turn off CyberCash for thi    $Config->{CyberCash} = 0;

 user

Changes are not persistent except when running in the foreground
(Debug mode).

=item %Db

A hash of databases shared with the C<[mvasp tables="foo"]> parameter
to the tag call. Once the database is shared, it is opened and can be
accessed by any of its methods. Again, this will not work with SQL
unless AllowGlobal is set for the catalog.

To get a reference to a particular table, specify its hash element:

    $ref = $Db{products};

The methods available:

    # access an element of the    $field = $ref->field($key, $column);

    # set an element of the table
    $ref->set_field($key, $column_name, $value);

    # atomic increment of an element of the table
    $ref->inc_field($key, $column_name, 1);

    # see if element of the table is numeric
    $is_numeric = $ref->numeric($column_name);

    # Quote for SQL query purposes
    $quoted = $ref->quote($value, $column_name);

    # Check configuration of the database
    $delimiter = $ref->config('DELIMITER');

    # Find the names of the columns (not including the key)
    @columns = $ref->columns();
    # Insert the key column name
    unshift @columns, $ref->config('KEY');

    # See if a column is in the table
    $is_a_column = defined $ref->test_column($column_name);

    # See if a row is in the table
    $is_present = $ref->record_exists($key);

    # Create a subroutine to return a single column from the table
    $sub = $ref->field_accessor($column);
    for (@keys) {
        push @values, $sub->($key);
    }

    # Create a subroutine to set a single column in the database
    $sub = $ref->field_settor($column);
    for (@keys) {
        $sub->($key, $value);
    }

    # Create a subroutine to set a slice of the database
    $sub = $ref->row_settor(@columns);
    for (@keys) {
        $sub->($key, @values);
    }

    # Retrurn a complete array of the database (minus the key)
    @values = $ref->row($key);

    # Retrurn a complete hash of the database row (minus the key)
    $hashref = $ref->row_hash($key);

    # Delete a record/row from the table
    $ref->delete_record($key);

table

=item %Sql

A hash of SQL databases that you shared with the C<[mvasp
tables="foo"]> parameter to the tag call. It returns the DBI database
handle, so things like the following can be done:    my $dbh = $Sql{products}
        or return HTML "Database not shared.";
    my $sth = $dbh->prepare('select * from products')
        or return HTML "Couldn't open database.";
    $sth->execute();
    my @record;
    while(@record = $sth->fetchrow()) {
        foo();
    }
    $sth = $dbh->prepare('select * from othertable')
        or return HTML "Couldn't open database.";
    $sth->execute();
    while(@record = $sth->fetchrow()) {
        bar();
    }
  %>


  <%

Again, this will not work with unless AllowGlobal is set for your
catalog.

=item $DbSearch

A search object which will search a database without using the text
file. It is the same as Interchange's C<db> searchtype. Options are
specified in a hash and passed to the object. All multiple-field
options should be passed as array references. Before using the
$DbSearch object, it must be told which table to search. For example,
to use the table C<foo>, it must have been shared with C<[mvasp foo]>.

There are three search methods: C<array>, C<hash>, and C<list>.

    array    Returns a reference to an array of arrays     hash     Returns a reference to an array of hashes (slower)
    list     Returns a reference to an array of tab-delimited lines

best)

\Example:

    $DbSearch->{table} = $Db
    $search = {

            mv_searchspec => 'Mona Lisa',
            mv_search_field => [ 'title', 'artist', 'price' ],
            mv_return_fields    => [ 'title' ]

        };

    my $ary = $DbSearch->array($search);

    if(! scalar @$ary) {
        return HTML "No match.\n";
    }

    for(@$ary) {

foo};

=item $Document

This is an object that has several routines associated with it.

 HTML $foo;                     # Append $foo to the write buffer $Document->write($foo);        # object call to append $foo to the write
                                # buffer array
 $Document->insert($foo);       # Insert $foo to front of write buffer array
 $Document->header($foo, $opt); # Append $foo to page header
 $Document->send();             # Send write buffer array to output, done
                                # automatically upon end of ASP, clears buffer
                                # and invalidates $Document->header()
 $Document->hot(1);             # Cause writes to send immediately
 $Document->hot(0);             # Stop immediate send
 @ary = $Document->review();    # Place contents of write buffer in @ary
 $Document->replace(@ary)       # Replace contents of write buffer with @ary
 $ary_ref = $Document->ref();   # Return ref to output buffer

array

=item $Document->write($foo)

Write $foo to the page in a buffered fashion. The buffer is an array
containing the results of all previous C<$Document->>C<write()>
operations. If $Document->hot(1) has been set, the output immediately
goes to the user.

=item $Document->insert($foo)

Insert $foo to the page buffer.

    $Document->write(    $Document->insert("1");
    $Document->send();

23");

will output "123", while

    $Document->write(    $Document->write("1");
    $Document->send();

23");

will output "231".

=item $Document->header($foo, $opt)

Add the header line $foo to the HTTP header. Use this to change the
page content type, cache options, or other attributes. The code below
changes the content type (MIME type) to text/plain:

    $Document->header("Content-type: text/plain");

There is an optional hash that can be sent, with the only valid value
being "replace." The below code scrubs all previous header lines:

    $Document->header("Content-type: text/plain", { replace => 1 } );

Once output has been sent with $Document->send(), this can no longer
be done.

=item $Document->hot($foo)

If the value of $foo is true (in a Perl sense), then all
$Document->write() operations will be immediately sent until a
$Document->hot(0) is executed.

=item $Document->send()

Causes the document write buffer to be sent to the browser and empties
the buffer. Any further $Document->header() calls will be ignored. Can
be used to implement non-parsed-header operation.

=item $Document->review()

Returns the value of the write buffer.

    @ary = $Document->review();

=item $Document->replace(@new)

Completely replaces the write buffer with the arguments.

=item $Document->ref()

Returns a reference to the write buffer.

    # Remove the first item in the write     my $ary_ref = $Document->ref();
    shift @$ary_ref;

uffer

=item HTML

Writes a string (or list of strings) to the write buffer array. The
call

    HTML $foo, $bar;

is exactly equivalent to

    $Document->write($foo, $bar);

Honors the $Document->hot() setting.

=item $Items

A reference to the current shopping cart. Unless an Interchange
C<[cart ...]> tag is used, it is normally the same as $Carts->{main}.

=item $Scratch

A reference to the scratch values ala C<[scratch foo]>.

   <% $Scratch->{foo} = 'bar'; %>

is equivalent to:

    [set foo]bar[/set]

=item $Session

A reference to the session values ala C<[data session username]>.

        my $out = $Session->{browser};
        $Document->write($out);
    %>

   <%

is equivalent to:

    [data session browser]

Values can also be set. If the value of C<[data session source]>
needed to be changed, for example, set:

        $Session->{source} = 'New_partner';
    %>

   <%

=item $Tag

Using the $Tag object, any Interchange tag including user-defined tags
can be accessed.

=back

B<IMPORTANT NOTE: >If the tag will access a database that has not been
previously opened, the table name must be passed in the ASP call. For
example:

=over 4

=item

HTML style:

    <HTML MV="mvasp" MV.TABLES="products pricing">

or

Named parameters:

    [mvasp tables="products pricing"]

or

Positional parameters:

    [mvasp products pricing]

Any tag can be called.

        my $user = $Session->{username};
        my $name_from_db = $Tag->data('userdb', 'name', $user );
        $Document->write($name_from_db);
    %>

   <%

is the same as:

    [data table=userdb column=name key="[data session username]"]

If the tag has a dash (C<->) in it, use an underscore instead:

    # WR    $Tag->shipping-desc('upsg');
    # Right
    $Tag->shipping_desc('upsg');

NG!!!

There are two ways of specifying parameters. Either use the positional
parameters as documented (for an authoritative look at the parameters,
inspect the %Routine value in Vend::Parse), or specify it all with an
option hash parameter names as in any named parameters as specified in
an Interchange tag. The calls

    $Tag->data('products', 'title', '00-0011');

and

    my $o                    table   => 'products',
                    column  => 'title',
                    key     => '00-0011',
                };

    $Tag->data( $opt );

t = {

are equivalent for the C<data> tag.

If using the option hash method, and the tag has container text,
either specify it in the hash parameter C<body> or add it as the next
argument. The two calls:

    $Tag->item_l                        'body' => "[item-code] [item-field title]",
                    });

st( {

and

    $Tag->item_list( { }, "[item-code] [item-field title]")

are equivalent.

Parameter names are ALWAYS lower case.

=back

=over 4

=item $Values

A reference to the user form values ala C<[value foo]>.

    <% $Document->write($Values->{foo}); %>

is equivalent to:

    [value foo]

=item &Log

Send a message to the error log (same as ::logError in GlobalSub or
global UserTag).

        Log("error log entry");
    %>

   <%

It prepends the normal timestamp with user and page information. To
supress that information, begin the message with a backslash (C<\>).

        Log("\\error log entry without timestamp");
        Log('\another error log entry without timestamp');
        Log("error log entry with timestamp");
    %>

=head1 Interchange Configuration Files

Interchange can and usually does run multiple catalogs on the same
server.

Cconfiguration directives are normally called with the directive as
the first word on the line, with it's value or values following.
Leading whitespace is stripped from the value. Additional files may be
called with an include file statement. Files are relative to the
catalog directory (or Interchange software directory, if in the main
C<interchange.cfg> file).

A type of "here document" can be used to specify Interchange
directives, with the usual Perl <<MARKER syntax. No semicolon is used
to terminate the marker.

=head1 interchange.cfg

The VendRoot directory, specified in the main program C<interchange>,
is the default location of all of the Interchange program,
configuration, special, and library files. Unless changed in the call
to C<interchange>, the main Interchange server configuration file will
be C<interchange.cfg> in the VendRoot directory.

The directives defined in C<interchange.cfg> affect the entire
Interchange server and all catalogs running under it. Multiple
Interchange servers may be run on the same machine with totally
independent operation.

=head2 ActionMap *global*

Specifies an action for use as a default. If the same action is
specified in C<catalog.cfg>, it will pertain. See C<ActionMap> in that
section.

=head2 AddDirective *global*

Adds a configuration directive that will be parsed for every
C<catalog.cfg> file. Accepts three parameters: the name of the
directive, the name of the parser (if any), and the default value (if
any). The following definition would add a directive "Foo," with
parser "parse_bar," and a default value of "Hello, world!":

   AddDirective  Foo  bar "Hello, world!"

If the parser is not defined, the directive value will be scalar and
the same as what the user passes in the config file. If defined, the
parser must be extant before it can be referenced, is always resident
in Vend::Config, and begins with the string C<parse_>. Examples can be
found in the files in the distribution software directory C<compat/>.

=head2 AdminSub *global*

Marks a global subroutine for use only by catalogs that are set to
C<AllowGlobal> (see below). Normally global subroutines can be
referenced (in embedded Perl) by any catalog.

   AdminSub  dangerous

=head2 AllowGlobal *global*

Specifies catalog identifiers that may define subroutines and UserTag
entries that can operate with the full permissions of the server.
B<Don't use this unless the catalog user is trusted implicitly.>
Default is blank.

   AllowGlobal  simple

=head2 AutoVariable *global*

Specifies directives which should be translated to Variable settings.
For scalars, the directive name becomes the Variable name and yields
its value, i.e. C<DescriptionField> becomes
C<__>C<DescriptionField__>, which would by default be C<description>.
Array variables have a C<_N> added, where C<_N> is the ordinal index,
i.e. C<ProductFiles> becomes C<__>C<ProductFiles_0__>,
C<__>C<ProductFiles_1__>, etc. Hash variables have a _KEY added, i.e.
C<SpecialPage> becomes C<__>C<SpecialPage_missing__>,
C<__>C<SpecialPage_violation>, etc. Doesn't handle hash keys that have
non-word characters or whitespace. Only single-level arrays and hashes
are translated properly.

   AutoVariable  PriceField DescriptionField ProductFiles SpecialPage

=head2 Catalog *global*

Specifies a catalog that can run using this Interchange server. There
are three required parameters, separated by spaces and/or tabs.

The first is the name of the catalog. It will be referred to by that
name in error, warning, and informational messages. It must contain
only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.

The second is the base directory of the catalog. If the directory does
not contain a C<catalog.cfg> file, the server will report an error and
refuse to start.

The third directive is very important to get right. It is the
C<SCRIPT_NAME> of the vlink program that runs the catalog. This name
must be unique from other CGI program paths that run on this server
because this is how the catalog is selected for operation.

   Catalog  simple /home/interchange/simple /cgi-bin/simple /simple

Any number of alias script names may be specified as additional
parameters. This allows the calling path to be different while still
calling the same catalog. This useful when calling an SSL server or a
members-only executable that requires a username/password via HTTP
Basic authorization. All branched links will be called using the
aliased URL.

Optionally, individual C<Catalog> lines that specify the different
parameters may be called. The equivalent of the above is:

   Catalog simple directory /home/interchange/simple
   Catalog simple script    /cgi-bin/simple
   Catalog simple alias     /simple

Global directives may be specified that will change for that catalog
only. This is mostly useful for C<ErrorFile> and C<DisplayErrors>:

   Catalog simple directive ErrorFile /var/log/interchange/simple_error.log

=head2 CheckHTML *global*

Set to the name of an external program that will check the users HTML
when they set C<[flag checkhtml]> or C<[tag flag checkhtml][/tag]> in
their page.

   CheckHTML  /usr/local/bin/weblint

=head2 ConfigAllAfter *global*

The name of a file (or files) which should be read as a part of every
catalog's configuration, after any other configuration files are read.
Default is C<catalog_after.cfg>.

   ConfigAllAfter   check_actions.cfg check_variables.cfg

=head2 ConfigAllBefore *global*

The name of a file (or files) which should be read as a part of every
catalog's configuration, before any other configuration files are
read. Default is C<catalog_before.cfg>.

   ConfigAllBefore   set_actions.cfg set_variables.cfg

=head2 ConfigParseComments *global*

Set to No if you want old-style '#include', '#ifdef', or '#ifndef' to
be treated as the comments they appear to be. The default is Yes,
which means both '#include' and 'include' do the same thing. (Use a
space after the '#' if you really want to comment out the command.)

Interchange prior to version 4.7 used a different syntax for
meta-directives 'include', 'ifdef', and 'ifndef' in configuration
files. The commands were borrowed from the C preprocessor, and true to
their C heritage, they started with '#': '#include', '#ifdef',
'#ifndef'. Interchange configuration files, unlike C, uses '#' to
begin one-line comments, which meant that a newcomer at first glance
might assume that:

 #Variable DEBUG 1
#include more.cfg

were both comments, when in fact the second was a live #include
command.

To begin to make things more consistent, Interchange 4.7 and up now
recognize those meta-directives without the leading '#', and the
included demo catalog sets this directive to No so that lines
beginning with '#' really are skipped as comments, regardless of what
comes after.

=head2 Database *global*

Defines a database which is global and available to all catalogs.
Writing can be controlled by catalog. See C<Database>.

=head2 DataTrace *global*

Set DBI to trace at the level specified. Valid values are:

0 - Trace disabled.

1 - Trace DBI method calls returning with results or errors.

2 - Trace method entry with parameters and returning with results.

3 - As above, adding some high-level information from the driver and
some internal information from the DBI.

4 - As above, adding more detailed information from the driver. Also
includes DBI mutex information when using threaded Perl.

5 and above - As above but with more and more obscure information.

Trace level 1 is best for most Interchange debug situations. Trace
will only be enabled when C<DebugFile> is specified, as that file is
the target for the trace. Example:

    DataTrace   1

Default is 0. Directive added in 4.7.0.

=head2 DebugFile *global*

Names a file, relative to the Interchange root directory, which should
store the output of C<logDebug> statements, and warnings if warnings
are enabled.

        DebugFile  /tmp/icdebug

=head2 DisplayErrors *global*

While all errors are reported in the error log file, errors can also
be displayed by the browser. This is convenient while testing a
configuration. Unless this is set, the C<DisplayErrors> setting in the
user catalogs will have no effect. Default is No.

   DisplayErrors       Yes

B<Note: >This changes the value of $SIG{__DIE__} and may have other
effects on program operation. This should NEVER be used for normal
operation.

=head2 DomainTail *global*

Implements the domain/IP session qualifiers so that only the major
domain is used to qualify the session ID. This is a compromise on
security, but it allows non-cookie-accepting browsers to use multiple
proxy servers in the same domain. Default is Yes.

   DomainTail No

If encrypting credit cards with PGP or GPG, or are using a payment
service like CyberCash, look at the C<WideOpen> directive, which
enables more browser compatibility at the cost of some security.

=head2 DumpStructure *global*

Tells Interchange to dump the structure of catalogs and the
Interchange server to a file with the catalog name and the extension
C<.structure>. Use this to see how directives have been set.

=head2 Environment *global*

Environment variables to inherit from the calling CGI link program. An
example might be PGPPATH, used to set the directory which PGP will use
to find its key ring.

   Environment  MOD_PERL REMOTE_USER PGPPATH

=head2 ErrorFile *global*

Sets the name of the global error log. The default is C<error.log> in
the Interchange software directory.

   ErrorFile  /var/log/interchange/log

Of course, the user ID running the Interchange server must have
permission to write that file.

Optionally, syslog error logging can be set up as well. See C<SysLog>.

=head2 FormAction *global*

Allows a form action (like the standard ones C<return, submit,
refresh,> etc.) to be set up. It requires a Perl subroutine as a
target:

   FormAction foo <<EOR
   sub {
       $CGI->{mv_nextpage} = 'bar';
   }
   EOR

If it returns a true (non-zero, non-empty) value, Interchange will
display the page defined in $CGI->{mv_nextpage}. Otherwise,
Interchange will not display any page. The default Interchange actions
can be overridden, if desired. There is also a catalog-specific
version of this directive, which overrides any action of the same
name.

The global version affects all catalogs -- there is also a
catalog-specific version of FormAction which is protected by Safe.

=head2 FullUrl *global*

Normally Interchange determines which catalog to call by determining
the SCRIPT_NAME from the CGI call. This means that different (and
maybe virtual) hosts cannot use the same SCRIPT_NAME to call different
catalogs. Set C<FullUrl> to Yes to differentiate based on the calling
host. Then, set the server name in the Catalog directive accordingly,
such as C<yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/simple>. A yes/no directive, the
default is No.

   FullUrl  Yes

If it is set in this fashion, C<all> catalogs must be defined in this
fashion. NOTE: The individual catalog setting will not work, as this
is used before the catalog name is known.

=head2 GlobalSub *global*

Defines a C<global> subroutine for use by the C<[perl sub] subname arg
/perl]> construct. Use the "here document" capability of Interchange
configuration files to make it easy to define:

   GlobalSub <<EOF

   sub count_orders {
       my $counter = new File::CounterFile "/tmp/count_orders", '1';
       my $number = $counter->inc();
       return "There have been $number orders placed.\n";
   }
   EOF

As with Perl "here documents," the EOF (or other end marker) must be
the ONLY thing on the line, with no leading or trailing white space.
Do not append a semicolon to the marker. (The above marker appears
indented. It should not be that way in the file!)

IMPORTANT NOTE: These global subroutines are not subject to security
checks. They can do most anything! For most purposes, scratch
subroutines or catalog subroutines (also Sub) are better.

C<GlobalSub> routines are subject to full Perl use strict checking, so
errors are possible if lexical variables or complete package
qualifications are not used for the variables.

=head2 HammerLock *global*

The number of seconds after which a locked session could be considered
to be lost due to malfunction. This will kill the lock on the session.
Only here for monitoring of session hand-off. If this error shows up
in the error log, the system setup should be examined. Default is 30.

   HammerLock          60

This mostly doesn't apply to Interchange when using the default
file-based sessions.

=head2 HitCount *global*

Increments a counter in C<ConfDir> for every access to the catalog.
The file is named C<hits.catalogname>, where C<catalogname> is the
short catalog identifier. A Yes/No directive, default is C<No>.

   HitCount  Yes

=head2 HouseKeeping *global*

How often, in seconds, the Interchange server will "wake up" and look
for user reconfiguration requests and hung search processes. On some
systems, this wakeup is the only time the server will terminate in
response to a stop command. Default is 60.

   HouseKeeping    5

=head2 IpHead *global*

Implements the domain/IP session qualifiers so that only the first
C<IpQuad> dot-quads of the IP address are used to qualify the session
ID. The default is 1. This is a slight compromise on security, but it
allows non-cookie-accepting browsers, like AOL's V2.0, to use multiple
proxy servers.

C<DomainTail> is preferable unless one of your HTTP servers does not
do host name lookups. Default is C<No>, and DomainTail must be set to
C<No> for it to operate.

   IpHead Yes

=head2 IpQuad *global*

The number of dot-quads that IpHead will look at. Default is 1.

   IpQuad  2

=head2 Locale *global*

Sets the global C<Locale> for use in error messages. Normally set from
a file's contents, as in the example before:

   Locale <locale.error

=head2 LockoutCommand *global*

The name of a command (as it would be entered from the shell) that
will lock out the host IP of an offending system. The IP address will
be substituted for the first occurrence of the string %s. This will be
executed with the user ID that Interchange runs under, so any commands
that require root access will have to be wrapped with an SUID program.

On Linux, a host may be locked out with:

   ipfwadm -I -i deny -S %s

This would require root permissions, however, under normal
circumstances. Use C<sudo> or another method to wrap and allow the
command.

A script can be written which modifies an appropriate access control
file, such as .htaccess for your CGI directory, to do another level of
lockout.  A simple command line containing C<perl -0777 -npi -e
's/deny/deny from %s\ndeny/' /home/me/cgi-bin/.htaccess> would work as
well (remember, the %s will become the IP address of the offending
user).

   LockoutCommand   lockout %s

=head2 LockType *global*

Allows selection of file locking method used throughout Interchange.
Options are 'flock', 'fcntl', and 'none'. Added in 4.7.0.

Default is flock. See the flock(2) manpage for details.

The fcntl setting is needed for NFS filesystems; for NFS-based locking
to work, the NFS lock daemon (lockd) must be enabled and running on
both the NFS client and server. Locking with fcntl works on Linux and
should work on Solaris, but is not guaranteed to work on all OSes.

The none setting turns off file locking entirely, but that is never
recommended. It might be useful to check if locking is causing hangs
on the system.

If you are only accessing sessions on an NFS-mounted directory but the
rest of Interchange is on the local filesystem, you can instead set
the SessionType catalog directive to 'NFS', which enables fcntl
locking for sessions only on a per-catalog basis.

=head2 Mall *global*

Set to C<Yes> to issue cookies only for the current catalog's script.
By default, when Interchange issues a cookie it does so for the base
domain. This will allow multiple catalogs to operate on the same
domain without interfering with each others session ID.

A yes/no directive.

   Mall   Yes

=head2 MaxServers *global*

The maximum number of servers that will be spawned to handle page
requests. If more than MaxServers requests are pending, they will be
queued (within the defined capability of the operating system, usually
five pending requests) until the number of active servers goes below
that value.

   MaxServers     4

Default is 10.

=head2 NoAbsolute *global*

Whether Interchange C<[file ...]> and other tags can read any file on
the system (that is readable by the user id running the Interchange
daemon). The default is No, which allows any file to be read. This
should be changed in a multi-user environment to minimize security
problems.

   NoAbsolute     Yes

=head2 PIDcheck *global*

If non-zero, enables a check of running Interchange processes during
the housekeeping routine. If a process has been running (or is hung)
for longer than PIDcheck seconds then a kill -9 will be issued and the
server count decremented. During the housekeeping routine, the number
of servers checked by C<MaxServers> will be recounted based on PID
files.

Default is 0, disabling the check.

   PIDcheck   300

If have long-running database builds, this needs to be disabled. Set
it to a high value (perhaps 600, for 10 minutes), or use the offline
script.

=head2 PIDfile *global*

The file which will contain the Interchange server process ID so that
it can be read to determine which proces should be sent a signal for
stopping or reconfiguring the server.

   PIDfile  /var/run/interchange/interchange.pid

This file must be writable by the Interchange server user ID.

=head2 Profiles *global*

Names a file (or files) which contain C<OrderProfile> and
C<SearchProfile> settings that will apply for all catalogs.

   Profiles     etc/profiles.common

=head2 SafeUntrap *global*

Sets the codes that will be untrapped in the C<Safe.pm> module and
used for embedded Perl and conditional operations. View the Safe.pm
documentation by typing C<perldoc Safe> at the command prompt. The
default is C<ftfile sort>, which untraps the file existence test
operator and the sort operator. Define it as blank to prevent any
operators but the default restrictive ones.

   SafeUntrap     ftfile sort ftewrite rand

=head2 SendMailProgram *global*

Specifies the program used to send email. Defaults to
'/usr/lib/sendmail'. If it is not found at startup, Interchange will
return an error message and refuse to start.

   SendMailProgram     /bin/mailer

A value of 'none' will disable the sending of emailed orders. Orders
must be read from a tracking file, log, or by other means.

=head2 SocketFile *global*

The name of the file which is used for UNIX-domain socket
communications. Must be in a directory where the Interchange user has
write permission.

   SocketFile  /var/run/interchange/interchange.socket

Default is C<etc/socket> or the value of the environment variable
MINIVEND_SOCKET. If set, it will override the environment. It can be
set on the command line as well:

   bin/interchange -r SocketFile=/tmp/interchange.socket

=head2 SocketPerms *global*

The permissions (prepend a 0 to use octal notation) that should be
used for the UNIX-domain socket. Temporarily set this to 666 on the
command line to debug a permission problem on C<vlink>.

   bin/interchange -r SocketPerms=0666

=head2 SubCatalog *global*

Allows definition of a catalog which shares most of the
characteristics of another catalog. Only the directives that are
changed from the base catalog are added. The parameters are: 1) the
catalog ID, 2) the base catalog ID, 3) the directory to use (typically
the same as the base catalog), and 4) the SCRIPT_NAME that will
trigger the catalog. Any additional parameters are aliases for the
SCRIPT_NAME.

The main reason that this would be used would be to conserve memory in
a series of stores that share most of the same pages or databases.

   SubCatalog   sample2 sample /usr/catalogs/sample /cgi-bin/sample2

=head2 SysLog *global*

Set up syslog(8) error logging for Interchange.

   SysLog  command  /usr/bin/logger
   SysLog  tag      int1
   SysLog  alert    local3.warn
   SysLog  warn     local3.info
   SysLog  info     local3.info
   SysLog  debug    local3.debug

This would cause global errors to be logged with the command:

   /usr/bin/logger -t int1 -p local3.alert

and cause system log entries something like:

   Oct 26 17:30:11 bill int1: Config 'co' at server startup
   Oct 26 17:30:11 bill int1: Config 'homefn' at server startup
   Oct 26 17:30:11 bill int1: Config 'simple' at server startup
   Oct 26 17:30:11 bill int1: Config 'test' at server startup
   Oct 26 17:30:13 bill int1: START server (2345) (INET and UNIX)

This would work in conjunction with a UNIX syslogd.conf entry of:

        # Log local3 stuff to Interchange log
        local3.*                /var/log/interchange.log

A custom wrapper can be created around it to get it to behave as
desired. For instance, if you didn't want to use syslog but instead
wanted to log to a database (via DBI), you could create a Perl script
named "logdatabase" to log things:

    #!/usr/bin/perl

    my $script_name = "logdatabase";
    use DBI;
    use Getopt::Std;

    getopts('d:p:T:k:')
        or die "$script_name options: $@\n";

    use vars qw/$opt_d $opt_p $opt_T $opt_k/;

    my $dsn   = $opt_d || $ENV{DBI_DSN};
    my $template = $opt_T
        || "insert into log values ('~~KEY~~', '~~LEVEL~~', '~~MSG~~')";

    my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn)
        or die "$script_name cannot connect to DBI: $DBI::errstr\n";

    my %data;

    $data{KEY} = $opt_k || '';

    local ($/);
    $data{MSG} = <>;

    $data{LEVEL} = $opt_p || 'interchange.info';

    $template =~ s/\~\~(\w+)\~\~/$dbh->quote($data{$1})/;

    my $sth = $dbh->prepare($template)
        or die "$script_name error executing query: $template\n";

    $sth->execute()
        or die "$script_name error executing query: $template\n";

    exit;

=head2 TcpHost *global*

When running in INET mode, using C<tlink>, specifies the hosts that
are allowed to send/receive transactions from any catalog on this
Interchange server. Can be either an name or IP number, and multiple
hosts can be specified in a space-separated list. Default is
localhost.

   TcpHost         localhost secure.domain.com

=head2 TcpMap *global*

When running in INET mode, using C<tlink> or the internal HTTP server,
specifies the port(s) which will be monitored by the Interchange
server. Default is 7786.

To use the internal HTTP server (perhaps only for password-protected
queries), a catalog may be mapped to a port. If three catalogs were
running on the server C<www.akopia.com>, named C<simple>, C<sample>,
and C<search>, the directive might look like this:

   TcpMap    7786 -  7787 simple 7788 sample 7789 search

B<Note: >To map large numbers of ports, use the <<MARKER here document
notation in interchange.cfg. With this in effect, the internal HTTP
server would map the following addresses:

   *:7786   mv_admin
   *:7787   simple
   *:7788   sample
   *:7789   search

B<Note: >This does not pertain to the use of C<tlink>, which still
relies on the CGI SCRIPT_PATH. To enable this, the SCRIPT_PATH aliases
/simple, /sample, etc. must be set in the C<Catalog> directive. This
would look like:

 Catalog  simple  /home/interchange/catalogs/simple /cgi-bin/simple /simple

To bind to specific IP addresses, add them in the same fashion that
they would as an Apache Listen directive:

   TcpMap <<EOF
       127.0.0.1:7786       -
       www.akopia.com:7787  -
   EOF

B<Note: >As usual, the EOF should be at the beginning of a line with
no leading or trailing whitespace.

=head2 TemplateDir *global*

Sets a directory which will be searched for pages if not found in the
user's C<pages> directory. Interchange uses this; use it to supply
some default pages so the user will not have them in their directory.

   TemplateDir    /usr/local/interchange/default_pages

The user's page, if it exists, will take precedence. There is also a
catalog-specific version of this directive. If a page is found in that
directory (or directories), it will take precedence.

=head2 TolerateGet *global*

Set to 'Yes' to enable parsing of both GET data and POST data when a
POST has been submitted. The default is 'No', which means that GET
data is ignored during a POST. Unfortunately this has to be a global
setting because at URL parse time, the Interchange daemon doesn't yet
know which catalog it's dealing with (due to catalog aliases, etc.).

=head2 UserTag *global*

This defines a UserTag which is global in nature, meaning not limited
by the C<Safe.pm> module, and is is available to all Interchange
catalogs running on the server. Otherwise, this is the same as a
catalog UserTag.

=head2 Variable *global*

Defines a global variable that will be available in all catalogs with
the notation @@Variable@@. Variable identifiers must begin with a
capital letter, and can contain only word characters (B<A-Z,a-z,0-9>
and underscore). They are case-sensitive. If using the
C<ParseVariables> directive, only variables in ALL CAPS will be
parsed. These are substituted first in any Interchange page, and can
contain any valid Interchange tags including catalog variables.

   Variable   DOCUMENT_ROOT   /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs

If a variable is called with @_VARIABLE_@, and there is no catalog
Variable with its name, the global Variable value will be inserted.

There are several standard variables which should not be used:

=over 4

=item MV_FILE

Name of the last file read in, as in C<[file ...]> or an externally
located perl routine.

=item MV_NO_CRYPT

Set this to 1 to disable encrypted passwords for the C<AdminUser>.

=item MV_PAGE

Name of the last page read in, as in the page called with mv_nextpage
or mv_orderpage.

=item CURRENCY, MV_CURRENCY

The current locale for currency.

=item LANG, MV_LANG

The current locale for language.

=back

=head2 VarName *global*

Sets the names of variables that will be remapped to and from the URL
when Interchange writes it. For instance, to display the variable
C<mv_session_id> as C<session> in the users URL:

   VarName   mv_session_id  session

The default can also be set in the C<etc/varnames> file after the
first time Interchange is run. Setting it in C<interchange.cfg> is
probably better for clarity.

There is also a catalog-specific version of this setting.

=head1 catalog.cfg

If multiple catalogs are to be run, each must have a C<catalog.cfg>
file located in the catalog base directory. It contains most of the
configurable parameters for Interchange. Each is independent from
catalog to catalog.

In the catalog configuration file, the directives C<MailOrderTo> and
C<VendURL> are required. They are not defined with defaults, and no
catalog will operate unless and until they are set with a value.

Many powerful procedures are available in the C<catalog.cfg> file.
First, set a C<Variable> and use its results in a subsequent
configuration setting if C<ParseVariables> is on:

   Variable   SERVER_NAME  www.akopia.com
   Variable   CGI_URL      /cgi-bin/demo

   ParseVariables Yes
   VendURL    http://__SERVER_NAME____CGI_URL__
   ParseVariables No

Values can be defined in multiline form by using the <<HERE document
method:

   Variable MYSTUFF <<EOF
       This is my stuff, and I
       am pretty proud of it.
   EOF

As with all here documents, the terminating string must be the ONLY
THING ON THE LINE. No leading or trailing characters are allowed, even
whitespace.

=over 4

=item Include single setting from file

Value can be pulled from a file with <file:

    Variable MYSTUFF <file

This works well for includes that must be of the highest possible
performance. They can be simply placed in a page with __VARIABLE__.

=item include

Other configuration files can be included in the current one. For
example, common settings can be set in one file:

    include common.cfg

Or all files in one directory:

    include usertag/*

=item ifdef and ifndef

ifdef/endif and ifndef/endif pairs can be used:

    Variable ORDERS_TO email_a
    ifdef ORDERS_TO
    ParseVariables Yes
    MailOrderTo __ORDERS_TO__
    ParseVariables No
    endif

    ifdef ORDERS_TO =~ /foo.com/
    # Send all orders at foo.com to one place now
    # Set ORDERS_TO to stop default setting
    Variable  ORDERS_TO  1
    MailOrderTo   orders@foo.com
    endif

    ifdef ORDERS_TO eq 'nobody@nowhere.com'
    # Better change to something else, set ORDERS_TO to stop default
    Variable  ORDERS_TO  1
    MailOrderTo   someone@somewhere.com
    endif

    ifndef ORDERS_TO
    #Needs to go somewhere....
    MailOrderTo  webmaster@localhost
    endif

dress

=item Define subroutine watches

Almost any configuration variable can be set up to be tied to a
subroutine if the Tie::Watch module is installed. It uses a notation
like the <<HERE document, but <&HERE is the notation. See
C<Interchange Programming> for details.

=back

=head2 Programming Watch Points in Catalog.cfg

Almost any configuration variable can be set up to be tied to a
subroutine if the C<Tie::Watch> module installed. It uses a notation
like the <<HERE document, but <&HERE is the notation. See
C<Interchange Programming> for details.

Here is a simple case:

   MailOrderTo orders@akopia.com
   MailOrderTo <&EOF
   sub {
       my($self, $default) = @_;
       if($Values->{special_handling}) {
           return 'vip@akopia.com';
       }
       else {
           return $default;
       }
   }
   EOF

When the order is mailed out, if the user has a variable called 
C<special_handling> set in their session (from UserDB, perhaps), the
order will be sent to 'vip@akopia.com.' Note the single quotes to
prevent problems with the @ sign. Otherwise, the order will get sent
to the previously defined value of C<orders@akopia.com>.

If the configuration value being watched is a SCALAR, the subroutine
gets the following call:

   &{$subref}(SELF, PREVIOUS_VALUE)

The subroutine should simply return the proper value.

SELF is a reference to the Tie::Watch object (read its documentation
for what all it can do) and C<PREVIOUS_VALUE> is the previously set
value for the directive. If set after the watch is set up, it will
simply have the effect of destroying the watch and having
unpredictable effects. (In the future, a "Store" routine may be able
to be set up that can subsequently set values).

If the configuration value being watched is an C<ARRAY>, the
subroutine gets the following call:

   &{$subref}(SELF, INDEX, PREVIOUS_VALUE)

C<INDEX> is the index of the array element being accessed. Setting up
watch points on array values is not recommended. Most Interchange
subroutines call arrays in their list context, and no access method is
provided for that.

If the configuration value being watched is a C<HASH>, the subroutine
gets the following call:

   &{$subref}(SELF, KEY, PREVIOUS_VALUE)

C<KEY> is the index into the hash, an example of C<HASH> type
Interchange configuration values. NOTE: The following is not
recommended for performance reasons. The Variable is a commonly used
thing and should not bear the extra overhead of tieing, but it
illustrates the power of this operation:

   Variable TESTIT Unwatch worked.

   Variable <&EOV
   sub {
       my ($self, $key, $orig) = @_;
       if($key eq 'TESTIT') {
           # only the first time
           if($Scratch->{$key}++) {
               $self->Unwatch();
               return $orig->{TESTIT};
           }
           else {
               return "Tie::Watch works! -- name=$Values->{name}";
           }
       }
       else {
           return $orig->{$key};
       }
   }
   EOV

The first time __TESTIT__ is called for a particular user, it will
return the string "Tie::Watch works! -- name=" along with their name
set in the session (if that exists). Any other variables will receive
the value that they were set to previously. Once the TESTIT key has
been accessed for that user, the watch is dropped upon the next
access.

=head2 Configuration Directives in Catalog.cfg

All directives except C<MailOrderTo> and C<VendURL> have default
values and are optional, though most catalogs will want to configure
some of them.

=head2 ActionMap

Allows setting of Interchange actions, usually with a Perl subroutine.
Actions are page names like:

 process  Perform a processing function
order    Order items
scan     Search based on path info
search   Search based on submitted form variables

These are the standard supplied actions for Interchange. They can be
overwritten with user-defined versions if desired. For example, to
ignore the C<order> action, set:

   ActionMap  order  sub { return 1 }

When the leading part of the incoming path is equal to C<order>, it
will trigger an action. The page name will be shifted up, and the
C<order> stripped from the page name. So this custom C<order> action
would essentially perform a no-op, and a URL like:

   <A HREF="[area order/nextpage]"> Go to the next page </A>

would be the equivalent of "[area nextpage]." If the action does not
return a true (non-zero, non-blank) status, no page will be displayed
by Interchange, not even the special C<missing> page. A response may
also be generated via Perl or MVASP.

The standard C<process> action has a number of associated
C<FormAction> settings. Besides using Perl, Interchange tags may be
used in an action, though they are not nearly as efficient.

=head2 AlwaysSecure

Determines whether checkout page operations should always be secure.
Set it to the pages that should always be secure, separated by spaces
and/or tabs.

   AlwaysSecure    ord/checkout

=head2 AsciiTrack

A file name to log formatted orders in. Unless preceded by a leading
'/', will be placed relative to the catalog directory. Disabled by
default.

   AsciiTrack     etc/tracking.asc

If a C<Route> is set up to C<supplant>, this is ignored.

=head2 Autoend

Sets an action that is automatically performed at the end every
access. It is performed after any page parsing occurs, just before the
transaction ends. See C<Autoload>.

=head2 Autoload

Sets an action that is automatically performed for every access. It is
performed before any page parsing occurs, and before the action or
page is even determined. Can contain ITL tags or a global subroutine
name. If the return value is true, a normal display of
$CGI->{mv_nextpage} will occur -- if it returns a false (zero, undef,
or blank) value, no page will be processed.

As an example, to remap any C<mv_nextpage> accesses to the C<private>
subdirectory of pages, set:

   Autoload   [perl] $CGI->{mv_nextpage} =~ s:^private/:public/:; [/perl]

=head2 AutoModifier

Sets an attribute in a shopping cart entry to the field of the same
name in the C<ProductsFile> pertaining to this item. This is useful
when doing shipping calculations or other embedded Perl that is based
on item attributes. To set whether an item is defined as "heavy" and
requires truck shipment, set:

   AutoModifier  heavy

When an item is added to the shopping cart using Interchange's
routines, the C<heavy> attribute will be set to the value of the
C<heavy> field in the products database. In the default demo that
would be C<products>. Any changes to C<ProductFiles> would affect
that, of course.

Some values are used by Interchange and are not legal:

       mv_mi
       mv_si
       mv_ib
       group
       code
       quantity
       item

=head2 CommonAdjust

Settings for Interchange pricing. See C<Chained pricing>.

   CommonAdjust    pricing:q2,q5,q10,q25, ;products:price, ==size:pricing

=head2 ConfigDir

The default directory where directive values will be read from when
using the <file notation. Default is C<config>. The name is relative
to the catalog directory unless preceded by a /.

   ConfigDir      variables

This can be changed several times in the C<catalog.cfg> file to pick
up values from more than one directory. Another possibility is to use
a C<Variable> setting to use different templates based on a setting:

   Variable   TEMPLATE   blue

   ParseVariables Yes
   ConfigDir  templates/__TEMPLATE__
   ParseVariables No
   Variable   MENUBAR   <menubar
   Variable   LEFTSIDE  <leftside
   Variable   BOTTOM    <bottom
   ConfigDir config

This will pick the C<templates/blue> template. If TEMPLATE is set to
C<red>, it would read the variables from C<templates/red>.

=head2 CookieDomain

Allows a domain to be set so that multiple servers can handle traffic.
For example, to use server addresses of C<secure.yourdomain.com> and
C<www.yourdomain.com>, set it to:

   CookieDomain    .yourdomain.com

More than one domain can be set. It must have at least two periods or
browsers will ignore it.

=head2 CookieLogin

Allows users to save their username/password (for Vend::UserDB) in a
cookie. Expiration is set by SaveExpire and is renewed each time they
log in. To cause the cookie to be generated originally, the CGI
variable C<mv_cookie_password> or C<mv_cookie_username> must be set.
The former causes both username and password to be saved; the latter
just the username.

   CookieLogin  Yes

Default is C<No>.

=head2 Cookies

Determines whether Interchange will send (and read back) a cookie to
get the session ID for links that go outside the catalog. Allows
arbitrary HREF links to be placed in Interchange pages, while still
saving the contents of the session. The default is Yes.

   Cookies         Yes

If the Cookies directive is enabled, and C<mv_save_session> is set
upon submission of a user form (or in the CGI variables through a Perl
C<GlobalSub>), the cookie will be persistent for the period defined by
C<SaveExpire>.

B<Note: >This should almost always be "Yes."

Caching, timed builds, and static page building will never be in
effect unless this directive is enabled.

=head2 CreditCardAuto

If set to Yes, enables the automatic encryption and saving of credit
card information. In order for this to work properly, the
C<EncryptProgram> directive must be set to properly encode the field.
The best way to set C<EncryptProgram> is with PGP in the ASCII armor
mode. This option uses the following standard fields on Interchange
order processing forms:

=over 4

=item C<mv_credit_card_number>

The actual credit card number, which will be wiped from memory after
checking to see if it is a valid Amex, Visa, MC, or Discover card
number. This variable will never be carried forward in the user
session.

=item C<mv_credit_card_exp_all>

The expiration date, as a text field in the form MM/YY (will take a
four-digit year as well). If it is not present, the fields
C<mv_credit_card_exp_month> and C<mv_credit_card_exp_year> are looked
at. It is set by Interchange when the card validation returns, if not
previously set.

=item C<mv_credit_card_exp_month>

The expiration date month, used if the C<mv_credit_card_exp_all> field
is not present. It is set by Interchange when the card validation
returns, if not previously set.

=item C<mv_credit_card_exp_year>

The expiration date year, used if the C<mv_credit_card_exp_all> field
is not present. It is set by Interchange when the card validation
returns, if not previously set.

=item C<mv_credit_card_error>

Set by Interchange to indicate the error if the card does not validate
properly. The error message is not too enlightening if validation is
the problem.

=item C<mv_credit_card_force>

Set this value to 1 to force Interchange to encrypt the card despite
its idea of validity. Will still set the flag for validity to 0 if the
number/date does not validate. Still won't accept badly formatted
expiration dates.

=item C<mv_credit_card_separate>

Set this value to 1 to cause Interchange encrypt only the card number
and not accompany it with the expiration date and card type.

=item C<mv_credit_card_info>

Set by Interchange to the encrypted card information if the card
validates properly. If PGP is used in ASCII armor mode, this field can
be placed on the order report and embedded in the order email, replete
with markers. This allows a secure order to be read for content,
without exposing the credit card number to risk.

=item C<mv_credit_card_valid>

Set by Interchange to true, or 1, if the the card validates properly.
Set to 0 otherwise.

=back

PGP is recommended as the encryption program, though remember that
U.S. commercial organizations may require a license for RSA.
Interchange will work with GPG, the Gnu Privacy Guard.

   CreditCardAuto     Yes

This should be turned off if using C<CyberCash>.

=head2 CustomShipping

If not blank, causes an error log entry if the shipping file entry is
not found. Not otherwise used for shipping. See C<SHIPPING> for how to
go about doing that.

   CustomShipping      Yes

=head2 CyberCash

A Yes/No directive, default is No. Enables CyberCash payment
protocols. See Using CyberCash.

   CyberCash           Yes

=head2 Database

Definition of an arbitrary database, in the form "Database database
file type," where "file" is the name of an ASCII file in the same
format as the products database. The file is relative to VendRoot.
Records can be accessed with the C<[data database field key]> tag.
Database names are restricted to the alphanumeric characters
(including the underscore), and it is recommended that they be either
all lower or all upper case. See C<DATABASES>.

   Database      reviews  reviews.txt  CSV

=head2 DatabaseDefault

Defines default parameters for a database. This can be used to set a
default WRITE_CONTROL setting, set a default USER or PASSWORD, etc. It
accepts any scalar setting, which means all B<except>:

ALTERNATE_* BINARY COLUMN_DEF DEFAULT FIELD_ALIAS FILTER_* NAME
NUMERIC POSTCREATE WRITE_CATALOG

This default setting is made when the table is initially defined, i.e.
explicit settings for the database itself override the defaults set.

   DatabaseDefault      WRITE_CONTROL   1
   DatabaseDefault      WRITE_TAGGED    1

This setting must be made *before* the database is defined. To reset
its value to empty, use the C<Replace> directive.

   Replace DatabaseDefault

=head2 DefaultShipping

This sets the default shipping mode by initializing the variable
C<mv_ship_mode>. If not set in C<catalog.cfg>, it is default.

   DefaultShipping     UPS

Somewhat deprecated, the same thing can be achieved with:

   ValuesDefault   mv_shipmode UPS

=head2 DescriptionField

The field that will be accessed with the C<[item-description]>
element.

   DescriptionField    description

Default is C<description>. It is not a fatal error if this field does
not exist. This is especially important for on-the-fly items. If there
is an attribute set to the same name as C<DescriptionField>, this will
be used for display.

=head2 DisplayErrors

If the administrator has enabled DisplayErrors globally, setting this
to "Yes" will display the error returned from Interchange in case
something is wrong with embedded Perl programs, tags, or Interchange
itself. Usually, this will be used during development or debugging.
Default is No.

   DisplayErrors       Yes

=head2 DynamicData

When set to one or more Interchange database identifiers, any pages
using data items from the specified database(s) will not be cached or
built statically. This allows dynamic updating of certain arbitrary
databases (even the products database) while still allowing
static/cached page performance gains on pages not using those data
items.

   DynamicData         inventory

Overridden by C<[tag flag build][/tag]>, depending on context.

=head2 EncryptProgram

Contains a program command line specification that indicates how an
external encryption program will work. Two placeholders, C<%p> and
C<%f>, are defined, which are replaced at encryption time with the
password and temporary file name respectively. See C<Order Security>.
This is separate from the PGP directive, which enables PGP encryption
of the entire order.

If PGP is the encryption program (Interchange determines this by
searching for the string C<pgp> in the command string), no password
field or file field need be used. The field C<mv_credit_card_number>
will never be written to disk in this case.

   EncryptProgram      /usr/local/bin/pgp -feat sales@company.com

If the order C<Route> method of sending orders is used (default in the
demo), this sets the default value of the C<encrypt_program>
attribute.

=head2 ErrorFile

This is where Interchange will write its runtime errors for THIS
CATALOG ONLY. It can be shared with other catalogs or the main
Interchange error log, but if it is root-based, permission to write
the file is required.

   ErrorFile   /home/interchange/error.log

=head2 ExtraSecure

Disallows access to pages which are marked with C<AlwaysSecure> unless
the browser is in HTTPS mode. A Yes/No directive, the default is 'No.'

   ExtraSecure  Yes

=head2 Filter

Assigns one or more filters (comma separated) to be automatically
applied to a variable.

As an example, multiple form variable submissions on the same page
come back null-separated, like 'value1\0value2\0value3'. To
automatically change those nulls to spaces, you could use this
directive:

 Filter  mail_list  null_to_space

Of course you could just as easily use the regular [filter] tag on the
page if the filter is only going to be used in a few places.

See the ictags document for more information, including a complete
list of filters.

=head2 FormAction

Allows set up of a form action (like the standard ones C<return,
submit, refresh,> etc.). It requires a Perl subroutine as a target:

   FormAction foo <<EOR
   sub {
       $CGI->{mv_nextpage} = 'bar';
   }
   EOR

If it returns a true (non-zero, non-empty) value, Interchange will
display the page defined in $CGI->{mv_nextpage}. Otherwise,
Interchange will not display any page. The default Interchange actions
can be overridden if desired. There is also a global version of this
directive, which is overridden if a catalog-specific action exists.

=head2 FormIgnore

Set to the name(s) of variables that should not be carried in the user
session values. Must match exactly and are case sensitive.

   FormIgnore    mv_searchtype

=head2 FractionalItems

Whether items in the shopping cart should be allowed to be fractional,
i.e., 2.5 or 1.25. Default is No.

   FractionalItems     Yes

=head2 Glimpse

The pathname for the C<glimpse> command, used if C<glimpse> searches
are to be enabled. To use C<glimpseserver>, the C<-C>, C<-J>, and
C<-K> tags must be used.

   Glimpse  /usr/local/bin/glimpse -C -J srch_engine -K2345

=head2 History

How many of the most recent user clicks should be stored in the
session history. Default is 0.

=head2 HTMLsuffix

The file extension that will be seen as a page in the C<pages>
directory. Default is C<.html>.

   HTMLsuffix .htm

=head2 ImageAlias

Aliases for images, ala Apache/NCSA, ScriptAlias, and Alias
directives. Relocates images based in a particular directory to
another for Interchange use; operates after C<ImageDir>. Useful for
editing Interchange pages with an HTML editor. Default is blank.

   ImageAlias  /images/  /thiscatalog/images/

=head2 ImageDir

The directory where all relative IMG and INPUT source file
specifications are based. IT MUST HAVE A TRAILING / TO WORK. If the
images are to be in the C<DocumentRoot> (of the HTTP server or virtual
server) subdirectory images, for example, use the C<ImageDir>
specification '/images/'. This would change SRC="order.gif" to
SRC="/images/order.gif" in IMG and INPUT tags. It has no effect on
other SRC tags.

   ImageDir /images/

Can be set in the Locale settings to allow different image sets for
different locales (MV3.07 and up).

=head2 ImageDirInternal

A value for C<ImageDir> only when the internal HTTP server is in use.
It must have a trailing / to work, and should always begin with a
fully-qualified path starting with C<http://>.

   ImageDirInternal http://www.server.name/images/

=head2 ImageDirSecure

A value for C<ImageDir> only when the pages are being served via
HTTPS. It must have a trailing / to work, and should always begin with
a fully-qualified path starting with C<http://>.

   ImageDirSecure   /secure/images/

This is useful if using separate HTTPS and HTTP servesr, and cannot
make the image directory path heads match.

=head2 Locale

Sets the special locale array. Tries to use POSIX C<setlocale> based
on the value of itself, then tries to accept a custom setting with the
proper definitions of C<mon_decimal_point>, C<thousands_sep>, and
C<frac_digits>, which are the the only international settings
required. Default, if not set, is to use US-English settings.

Example of the custom setting:

   Locale     custom mon_decimal_point , mon_thousands_sep . frac_digits 0

Example of POSIX setlocale for France, if properly aliased:

   Locale     fr

See C<setlocale(3)> for more information. If embedded Perl code is
used to sort search returns, the C<setlocale()> will carry through to
string collation.

See Internationalization.

=head2 LocaleDatabase

Set to the Interchange database identifier of a table that contains
C<Locale> settings. These settings add on to and overwrite any that
are set in the catalog configuration files, including any include
files.

   Database       locale  locale.asc  TAB
   LocaleDatabase locale

=head2 MailOrderTo

Specifies the e-mail address to mail completed orders to.

       MailOrderTo  orders@xyzcorp.com

If 'none' is specified, no e-mailed order will be sent.

=head2 NoCache

The names of Interchange pages that are not to be built statically if
STATIC PAGE BUILDING is in use. If the name is a directory, no pages
in that directory (or any below it) will be cached or built
statically.

   NoCache    ord
   NoCache    special

=head2 NoImport

When set to one or more Interchange database identifiers, those
database(s) will never be subject to import. Useful for SQL databases
or databases that will "never" change.

   NoImport   inventory

=head2 NonTaxableField

The name of the field in the products database that is set (to 1 or
Yes) if an item is not to be taxed. Interchange will log an error and
tax it anyway if the field doesn't exist in the database. Blank by
default, disabling the feature.

   NonTaxableField    wholesale

=head2 OfflineDir

The location of the offline database files for use with the
Interchange offline database build command. Set to "offline" as the
default, and is relative to VendRoot if there is no leading slash.

   OfflineDir          /usr/data/interchange/offline

=head2 OnFly

Enables on-the-fly item additions to the shopping cart. If set to the
name of a valid UserTag, that tag definition will be used to parse and
format the item with the following call:

   $item = Vend::Parse::do_tag($Vend::Cfg->{OnFly},
                                   $code,
                                   $quantity,
                                   $fly[$j],
                               );

$fly[$j] is the value of C<mv_order_fly> for that item. An C<onfly>
tag is provided by Interchange. See <On-the-fly> ordering.

=head2 OrderCounter

The name of the file (relative to catalog root if no leading /) that
maintains the order number counter. If not set, the order will be
assigned a string based on the time of the order and the user's
session number.

   OrderCounter       etc/order.number

Bear in mind that Interchange provides the order number as a
convenience for display, and that no internal functions depend on it.
Custom order number routines may be defined and used without fear of
consequences.

If a C<Route> is set up to C<supplant> and the C<counter> attribute is
set there, this is ignored.

=head2 OrderLineLimit

The number of items that the user is allowed to place in the shopping
cart. Some poorly-mannered robots may "attack" a site by following all
links one after another. Some even ignore any C<robots.txt> file that
may have been created. If one of these bad robots orders several dozen
or more items, the time required to save and restore the shopping cart
from the user session may become excessive.

If the limit is exceeded, the command defined in the Global directive
C<LockoutCommand> will be executed and the shopping cart will be
emptied. The default is 0, disabling the check. Set it to a number
greater than the number of line items a user is ever expected to
order.

   OrderLineLimit   50

=head2 OrderProfile

Allows an unlimited number of profiles to be set up, specifying
complex checks to be performed at each of the steps in the checkout
process. The files specified can be located anywhere. If relative
paths are used, they are relative to the catalog root directory.

   OrderProfile    etc/profiles.order etc/profiles.login

The actions defined here are also used for C<mv_click> actions if
there is no action defined in C<scratch> space. They are accessed by
setting the C<mv_order_profile> variable to the name of the order
profile. Multiple profiles can reside in the same file, if separated
by C<__END__> tokens, which must be on a line by themselves.

The profile is named by placing a name following a C<__NAME__> pragma:

 __NAME__ billing

The C<__NAME__> must begin the line, and be followed by whitespace and
the name. The search profile can then be accessed by
<mv_order_profile="billing">. See Advanced Multi-level Order Pages.

=head2 OrderReport

The location of the simple order report file. Defaults to etc/report.

   OrderReport          /data/order-form

=head2 PageDir

Location of catalog pages. Defaults to the pages subdirectory in the
VendRoot directory.

   PageDir    /data/catalog/pages

Can be set in the C<Locale> settings to allow different page sets for
different locales.

=head2 PageSelectField

Sets a products database column which can be used to select the
on-the-fly template page. This allows multiple on-the-fly pages to be
defined. If the field is empty (no spaces), the default C<flypage>
will be used.

   PageSelectField    display_page

=head2 ParseVariables

Determines whether global and catalog variables will be parsed in the
configuration file. Default is No. The foundation catalog.cfg turns
ParseVariables on and usually expects it to be on.

   Variable STORE_ID  topshop
   ParseVariables Yes
   StaticDir  /home/__STORE_ID__/www/cat
   ParseVariables No

=head2 Password

The encrypted or unencrypted password (depending on Variable
MV_NO_CRYPT) that will cause internal authorization checks for
RemoteUser to allow access.

Below is the encrypted setting for a C<blank> password.

   Password                bAWoVkuzphOX.

=head2 PGP

If credit card information is to be accepted, and the e-mailed order
will go over an insecure network to reach its destination, PGP
security should be used. The key ring to be used must be for the user
that is running the Interchange server, or defined by the environment
variable C<PGPPATH>, and the key user specified must have a key on the
public key ring of that user.

   PGP        /usr/local/bin/pgp -feat orders@company.com

If this directive is non-null, the PGP command string as specified
will be used to encrypt the entire order in addition to any encryption
done as a result if C<CreditCardAuto>. If, for some reason, an error
comes from PGP, the customer will be given the special page C<failed>.

If a C<Route> is set up to C<supplant>, this is ignored.

=head2 Pragma

Sets the default value of an Interchange pragma. The directive is set
like this:

   Pragma my_pragma_name

To enable a pragma for only a particular page, set it anywhere in the
page:

   [pragma my_pragma_name]

To disable a pragma for a particular page, set it anywhere in the
page:

   [pragma my_pragma_name 0]

There are currently only three pragmas:

=over 4

=item no_html_parse

=back

Disallows HTML tag parsing. This is a B<big> parser performance gain
and is enabled in the demo catalog.

When this pragma is set, you can't encapsulate Interchange tags inside
HTML tags like this:

   <P MV="if scratch something"> ... </P>

Note that a page with no HTML parsing is a good place to put a DTD
(document type descriptor).

=over 4

=item no_image_rewrite

=back

Prevents image locations in pages from being altered by Interchange.
Added in Interchange 4.7.0.

Interchange normally rewrites image locations to point to ImageDir.
This applies to image locations mentioned in <img src="...">, <input
src="...">, <body background="...">, <table background="...">, and
<tr/th/td background="...">.

When this pragma is B<not> set, the following tag:

   <img src="fancy.gif">

Would, assuming an ImageDir set to /foundation/images, be transformed
into:

   <img src="/foundation/images/fancy.gif">

When pragma no_image_rewrite B<is> set, the <img> tag would remain
unchanged.

=over 4

=item strip_white

=back

Set this to strip whitespace from the tops of HTML pages output by
Interchange. Such whitespace usually comes from Interchange tags at
the top of the page. The pragma's purpose is mostly to make 'view
source' in the browser a slightly more tolerable experience.

Default is off; whitespace is unchanged.

=head2 PriceCommas

If no commas are desired in price numbers (for the C<[item-price]>
tag), set this to C<No>. The default is to use commas (or whatever is
the thousands separator for a locale).

   PriceCommas         no

This is overridden if a Locale C<price_picture> is set.

=head2 PriceDivide

The number the price should be divided by to get the price in units
(dollars or such). The default is one. If penny pricing is used, set
it to 100.

   PriceDivide         100

Can be set in the C<Locale> settings to allow a price adjustment
factor for different currencies.

=head2 PriceField

The field in the product database that will be accessed with the
C<[item-price]> element. Default is "price."

   PriceField          ProductPrice

Can be set in the C<Locale> settings to allow different price fields
for different currencies.

=head2 ProductDir

Location of the database files. Defaults to the products subdirectory
of the VendRoot directory. May not be set to an absolute directory
unless C<NoAbsolute> is defined as No.

   ProductDir          /data/catalog/for-sale

Most people never set this directive and use the default of
C<products>.

=head2 ProductFiles

Database tables that should be seen as the "products" database.

   ProductFiles    vendor_a vendor_b

The key thing about this is that each will be searched in sequence for
a product code to order or an C<[item-field ....]> or C<[loop-field
...]> to insert. The main difference between C<[item-field ....]> and
C<[item-data table ...]> is this fall-through behavior.

Default is C<products>.

=head2 ReadPermission and WritePermission

By default, only the user account that Interchange runs under (as set
by the SETUID permission on vlink) can read and write files created by
Interchange. C<WritePermission> and C<ReadPermission> can be set to
C<user>, C<group>, or 'world'.

   ReadPermission      group
   WritePermission     group

=head2 RemoteUser

The value of the HTTP environment variable C<REMOTE_USER> that will
enable catalog reconfiguration. HTTP basic authentication must be
enabled for this to work. Default is blank, disabling this check.

   RemoteUser   interchange

=head2 Replace

Causes a directive to be emptied and re-set (to its default if no
value is specified). Useful for directives that add to the value by
default.

   Replace NoCache ord special multi reconfig query

Capitalization must be exact on each directive.

=head2 Require

Forces a Perl module, global C<UserTag>, or C<GlobalSub> to be present
before the catalog will configure. This is useful when transporting
catalogs to make sure they will have all needed facilities.

   Require usertag   email
   Require globalsub form_mail
   Require module    Business::UPS

=head2 RobotLimit

The RobotLimit directive defines the number of consecutive pages a
user session may access without a 30 second pause. If the limit is
exceeded, the command defined in the Global directive
C<LockoutCommand> will be executed and catalog URLs will be rewritten
with host 127.0.0.1, sending the robot back to itself. The default is
0, disabling the check.

   RobotLimit  200

=head2 Route

Sets up order routes. See C<Custom Order Routing>. There are examples
in the demo C<simple>.

=head2 SalesTax

If non-blank, enables automatic addition of sales tax based on the
order form. The value is a comma-separated list of the field names (as
placed in order.html) in priority order, which should be used to look
up sales tax percentage in the C<salestax.asc> database. This database
is not supplied with Interchange. It is typically received from a
third party by quarterly or monthly subscription.

   SalesTax            zip state

=head2 SalesTaxFunction

A Perl subroutine that will return a hash reference with the sales tax
settings. This can be used to query a database for the tax for a
particular vendor:

   SalesTaxFunction  <<EOR
         my $vendor_id = $Session->{source};
       my $tax = $TextSearch->hash( {
                           se => $vendor_id,
                           fi => 'salestax.asc',
                           sf => 'vendor_code',
                           ml => 1000,
                           } );
       $tax = {} if ! $tax;
       $tax->{DEFAULT} = 0.0;
       return $tax;
   EOR

or simply produce a table:

   SalesTaxFunction  <<EOR
    return {
        DEFAULT => 0.0,
        IL => 0.075,
        OH => 0.065,
    };
EOR

A C<DEFAULT> value must always be returned or the function will be
ignored.

=head2 SaveExpire

The default amount of time that a cookie will be valid (other than the
MV_SESSION_ID cookie). The ones used in Interchange by default are
C<MV_USERNAME> and C<MV_PASSWORD> for the C<CookieLogin> feature.
Specified the same as C<SessionExpire>, with an integer number
followed by one of C<minutes>, C<hours>, C<days>, or C<weeks>.

   SaveExpire 52 weeks

Default is C<30 days>.

=head2 ScratchDefault

The default scratch variable settings that the user will start with
when their session is initialized. To disable placing URL rewrite
strings after the user has given a cookie, set:

   ScratchDefault  mv_no_session_id  1
   ScratchDefault  mv_no_count       1
   ScratchDefault  mv_add_dot_html   1

=head2 ScratchDir

The directory where temporary files will be written, notably cached
searches and retired session IDs. Defaults to C<tmp> in the catalog
directory.

   ScratchDir          /tmp

=head2 SearchProfile

Allows an unlimited number of search profiles to be set up, specifying
complex searches based on a single click. The directive accepts a file
name based in the catalog directory if the path is relative:

   SearchProfile    etc/search.profiles

As an added measure of control, the specification is evaluated with
the special Interchange tag syntax to provide conditional setting of
search parameters. The following file specifies a dictionary-based
search in the file 'dict.product':

 __NAME__ dict_search
 mv_search_file=dict.product
 mv_return_fields=1
 [if value fast_search]
   mv_dict_limit=-1
   mv_last=1
 [/if]
 __END__

The C<__NAME__> is the value to be specified in the C<mv_profile>
variable on the search form, as in

 <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=mv_profile VALUE="dict_search">

or with mp=profile in the one-click search.

 [page scan se=Renaissance/mp=dict_search]Renaissance Art[/page]

Multiple profiles can reside in the same file, if separated by
C<__END__> tokens. C<__NAME__> tokens should be left-aligned, and
C<__END__> must be on a line by itself with no leading or trailing
whitespace.

=head2 SecureURL

The base URL for secure forms/page transmissions. Normally it is the
same as VendURL except for the C<https:> protocol definition. Default
is blank, disabling secure access.

   SecureURL   https://machine.com/xyzcorp/cgi-bin/vlink

=head2 SendMailProgram

The location of the sendmail binary, needed for mailing orders. Must
be found at startup. This often needs to be set for FreeBSD or BSDI.

  SendMailProgram    /usr/sbin/sendmail

If set to C<none>, no mail can be sent by standard Interchange
facilities. The default is the value in C<interchange.cfg> and varies
depending on operating system.

=head2 SeparateItems

Changes the default when ordering an item via Interchange to allowing
multiple lines on the order form for each item. The default, C<No>,
puts all orders with the same part number on the same line.

Setting C<SeparateItems> to C<Yes> allows the item attributes to be
easily set for different instances of the same part number, allowing
easy setting of things such as size or color.

   SeparateItems       Yes

Can be overridden with the C<mv_separate_items> variables (both
scratch and values).

=head2 SessionDatabase

When storing sessions, specify the name of the directory or DBM file
to use. The file extensions of .db or .gdbm (depending on the DBM
implementation used) will be appended. If the default file-based
sessions are used, it is the name of the directory.

   SessionDatabase     session-data

Can be an absolute path name, if desired.

It is possible for multiple catalogs to share the same session file,
as well as for multiple Interchange servers to serve the same
catalogs. If serving a extremely busy store, multiple parallel
Interchange servers can share the same NFS-based file system and serve
users in a "ping-pong" fashion using the file-based sessions. On huge
systems, the level of directory hashing may be changed. By default,
only 48 * 48 hashing is done. See the source for C<SessionFile.pm>.

=head2 SessionDB

The name of the Interchange database to be used for sessions if DBI is
specified as the session type. This is not recommended.

=head2 SessionExpire

A customer can exit the browser or leave the catalog pages at any
time, and no indication is given to the web server aside from the lack
of further requests that have the same session ID. Old session
information needs to be periodically expired. The C<SessionExpire>
specifies the minimum time to keep track of session information.
Defaults to one day. Format is an integer number, followed by
s(econds), m(inutes), h(ours), d(ays), or w(eeks).

   SessionExpire       20 minutes

If C<CookieLogin> is in use, this can be a small value. If the
customer's browser has the Interchange session cookie stored, he/she
will be automatically logged back in with the next request. Note,
however, that the customer's cart and session values will be reset.

=head2 SessionLockFile

The file to use for locking coordination of the sessions.

   SessionLockFile     session-data.lock

This only applies when using DBM-based sessions. It is possible for
multiple catalogs to share the same session file. C<SessionDatabase>
needs to be set appropriately if the database is to be shared.
Defaults to C<session.lock>, which is appropriate for separate session
files (and therefore standalone catalogs). Can be an absolute path
name, if desired.

=head2 SessionType

The type of session management to be used. Use one of the following:

   DB_File     Berkeley DB
   DBI         DBI (don't use this!)
   File        File-based sessions (the default)
   NFS         File-based sessions, forces use of fcntl locking
   GDBM        GDBM

The default is file-based sessions, which provides the best
performance and reliablility in most environments.

If you are planning on running Interchange servers with an NFS-mounted
filesystem as the session target, you must set SessionType to "NFS".
The other requisites are usually:

1. fcntl() supported in Perl 2. lock daemon running on NFS server
system 3. lock daemon running on Interchange server

See also the global directive LockType.

=head2 SpecialPage

Sets a special page to other than its default value. Can be set as
many times as necessary. Will have no effect if not one of the
Interchange Required Pages.

   SpecialPage         checkout ord/checkout
   SpecialPage         failed special/error_on_order
   SpecialPage         interact special/browser_problem
   SpecialPage         noproduct special/no_product_found
   SpecialPage         order  ord/basket
   SpecialPage         search srch/results

=head2 SpecialPageDir

The directory where special pages are kept. Defaults to
C<special_pages> in the catalog directory.

   SpecialPageDir      pages/special

=head2 Static

A Yes/No directive. Enables static page building and display features.
Default is C<No>.

    Static   Yes

=head2 StaticAll

A Yes/No directive. Tells Interchange to try and build all pages in
the catalog statically when called with the static page build option.
This is subject to the settings of C<StaticFly>, C<StaticPath>, and
C<NoCache>. Default is No. Pages that have dynamic elements will not
be built statically, though that may be overridden with C<[tag flag
build][/tag]> on the page in question.

    StaticAll   Yes

=head2 StaticDepth

The number of levels of static search building that will be done if a
search results page contains a search. Default is one, though it could
be very long if set higher. Set to 0 to disable re-scanning of search
results pages.

    StaticDepth 2

=head2 StaticDir

The absolute path of the directory which should be used as the root
for static pages. The user ID executing Interchange must have write
permission on the directory (and all files within) if this is to work.

    StaticDir   /home/you/www/catalog

=head2 StaticFly

A Yes/No directive. If set to C<Yes>, static builds will attempt to
generate a page for every part number in the database using the
on-the-fly page build capability. If pages are already present with
those names, they will be overwritten. The default is C<No>.

    StaticFly   Yes

=head2 StaticPage

Tells Interchange to build the named page (or pages, whitespace
separated) when employing the static page-building capability of
Interchange. Not necessary if using C<StaticAll>.

    StaticPage   info/about_us  info/terms_and_conditions

=head2 StaticPath

The path (relative to HTTP document root) which should be used in
pages built with the static page-building capability of Interchange.

    StaticPath    /catalog

=head2 StaticPattern

A perl regular expression which is used to qualify pages that are to
be built statically. The default is blank, which means all pages
qualify.

    StaticPattern  ^info|^help

=head2 StaticSuffix

The extension to be appended to a normal Interchange page name when
building statically. Default is C<.html>. Also affects the name of
pages in the Interchange page directory. If set C<to .htm>, the pages
must be named with that extension.

    StaticSuffix   .htm

=head2 Sub

Defines a catalog subroutine for use by the C<[perl][/perl]> or
[mvasp] embedded perl languages. Use the "here document" capability of
Interchange configuration files to make it easy to define:

   Sub <<EOF
   sub sort_cart_by_quantity {
       my($items) = @_;
       $items = $Items if ! $items;
       my $out = '<TABLE BORDER=1>';
       @$items = sort { $a->{quantity} <=> $b->{quantity} } @$items;
       foreach $item (@$items) {
           my $code = $item->{code};
           $out .= '<TR><TD>';
           $out .= $code;
           $out .= '</TD><TD>';
           $out .= $Tag->data('products', 'name', $code);
           $out .= '</TD><TD>';
           $out .= $Tag->data('products', 'price', $code);
           $out .= '</TD></TR>';
       }
       $out .= '&lt/TABLE>';
       return $out;
   }
   EOF

As with Perl "here documents," the EOF (or other end marker) must be
the ONLY thing on the line, with no leading or trailing white space.
Do not append a semicolon to the marker. The above would be called
with:

   [perl]
       my $cart = $Carts->{main};
       return sort_cart($cart);
   [/perl]

and will display an HTML table of the items in the current shopping
cart, sorted by the quantity. Syntax errors will be reported at
catalog startup time.

Catalog subroutines may not perform unsafe operations. The Safe.pm
module enforces this unless global operations are allowed for the
catalog. See C<AllowGlobal>.

=head2 Suggests

Generates a warning message when a Perl module, global C<UserTag>, or
C<GlobalSub> is not present at catalog configuration time. Same as the
C<Require> directive except not fatal.

   Suggest usertag   table_editor
   Suggest globalsub file_info
   Suggest module    Business::UPS

=head2 TableRestrict

Used to provide "views" in database-based searches. Does not affect
the text searches. Affects the table being searched.

Takes the form of C<field=session_param>, where C<field> is a column
in the table being iterated over, and C<session_param> is a
C<$Session> key (i.e., [data session username]).

   TableRestrict  products  owner=username

The above would prevent the database search from returning any records
except those where the column C<owner> contains the current value of
C<[data session username]>.

Probably most usefully set by embedded Perl code in certain
situations. For example:

   [calc]
       # Restrict edit to owned fields
       $Config->{TableRestrict}{products} = 'owner=username';
       return;
   [/calc]

When using SQL-based databases, in effect it turns the base search
query

   select * from products

into

   select * from products where owner = '[data session username]'

Interchange databases are similarly affected, though the methodology
is different. Also may be useful in "mall" situations, where user is
allowed to only see products from the current store ID.

=head2 TaxShipping

A comma or space-separated list of states or jurisdictions that tax
shipping cost, i.e., UT. Blank by default, never taxing shipping.

   TaxShipping         UT,NV,94024

=head2 TrackFile

Name of a logfile that tracks user traffic. This is used in the back
office administration report on traffic by affiliate.

The default is that no such file is kept.

=head2 UpsZoneFile

The file containing the UPS zone information, specified relative to
the catalog directory unless it begins with a /. It can be in the
format distributed by UPS or can be in a tab-delimited format, with
the three-letter zip prefix of the customer used to determine the
zone. It interpolates based on the value in C<mv_shipmode>. A user
database named the same as the mv_shipmode variable must be present or
the lookup will return zero.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Zone information and updated pricing from UPS must be
obtained in order for this to work properly. The zone information is
specific to a region!

   UpsZoneFile         /usr/interchange/data/ups_zone.asc

=head2 UseModifier

Determines whether any attributes, the modifiers specified in the
directive, can be attached to the item. See C<Item Attributes>. The
default is no modifier. Don't use a value of C<quantity> or this
directive will not work properly.

   UseModifier         size,color

Some values are used by Interchange and are not legal:

       mv_mi
       mv_si
       mv_ib
       group
       code
       quantity
       item

=head2 ValuesDefault

Sets the initial state of the user values, i.e., [value key] or
$Values->{key}.

   ValuesDefault   fname  New
   ValuesDefault   lname  User

When the user session starts, C<[value fname] [value lname]> will be
"New User."

=head2 Variable

Defines a catalog variable that will be available in the current
catalog with the notation C<__Variable__>. Variable identifiers must
begin with a capital letter, and can contain only word characters
(B<A-Z,a-z,0-9> and underscore). These are substituted second (right
after global Variables) in any Interchange page, and can contain any
valid Interchange tags except global variables.

   Variable   DOCUMENT_ROOT   /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs

=head2 VariableDatabase

The name of a database containing a field Variable which will be used
to set Interchange variable values. For example, a database defined
as:

   Database  var var.txt TAB
   VariableDatabase var

and containing

   code    Variable
   HELLO   Hi!

would cause C<__HELLO__> to appear as C<Hi!>.

The field name is case-sensitive, and C<variable> would not work.

The values are inserted at time of definition. Any single-level
hash-oriented Interchange directive, such as C<SpecialPage>,
C<ScratchDefault>, or C<ValuesDefault>, can be set in the same way. If
the C<VariableDatabase> named does not exist at definition time, a
database of the default type with an ASCII file source appending
C<.txt> is assumed. In other words:

   VariableDatabase variable

is equivalent to

   Database         variable variable.txt TAB
   VariableDatabase variable

=head2 VendURL

Specifies the base URL that will run vlink as a cgi-bin program.

       VendURL  http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink

=head2 WideOpen

Disables IP qualification of user sessions. B<This degrades catalog
security.> Do not use unless using PGP/CreditCardAuto or CyberCash.

=head1 Administering Interchange

Some utilities are supplied in the VendRoot/bin directory:

 compile_link Compiles an Interchange vlink or tlink CGI link
 dump         Dumps the session file for a particular catalog
 expire       Expires sessions for a particular catalog
 expireall    Expires all catalogs
 offline      Does offline build of the database(s)
 update       Does in-place update of the database(s)
 makecat      Make catalog

Some example scripts for other functions are in the C<eg/> directory
of the software distribution; see the readme file there.

Some thought should be given to where the databases, error logs, and
session files should be located, especially on an ISP that might have
multiple users sharing an Interchange server. In particular, put all
of the session files and logs in a directory that is not writable by
the user. This eliminates the possibility that the catalog may crash
if the directory or file is corrupted.

To test the format of user catalog configuration files before
restarting the server, set (from VendRoot):

   bin/interchange -test

This will check all configuration files for syntax errors, which might
otherwise prevent a catalog from booting. Once a catalog configures
properly, user reconfiguration will not crash it. It will just cause
an error. But, it must come up when the server is started.

=head2 Starting, Stopping, and Re-starting the Servers

The following commands need to have VENDROOT changed to the main
directory where Interchange is installed. If the Interchange base
directory is C</home/interchange/>, the start command would be
C</home/interchange/bin/interchange>.

Do a C<perldoc VENDROOT/bin/interchange> for full documentation.

To start the server with default settings:

   VENDROOT/bin/interchange

It is usually best to issue a restart, otherwise the server will not
run anew if a server is already running.

   VENDROOT/bin/interchange -restart

Assuming the server starts correctly, the names of catalogs as they
are configured will be displayed, along with a message stating the
process ID it is running under.

To re-start the server:

   VENDROOT/bin/interchange -restart

C<-r> is the same as C<-restart>.

This is typically done to force Interchange to re-read its
configuration. A message will be displayed stating that a TERM signal
has been sent to the process ID the servers are running under. This
information is also sent to C<home/interchange/error.log>. Check the
error.log file for confirmation that the server has restarted
properly.

To stop the server:

   VENDROOT/bin/interchange -stop

A message will be displayed stating that a TERM signal has been sent
to the process ID the server is running under. This information is
also sent to C</home/interchange/error.log>.

Because processes waiting for selection on some operating systems
block signals, they may have to wait for HouseKeeping seconds to stop.
The default is 60.

To terminate the Interchange server with prejudice, in the event it
will not stop:

   VENDROOT/bin/interchange -kill

=head2 UNIX and INET modes

Both UNIX-domain and INET-domain sockets can be used for
communication. INET domain sockets are useful when more than one
server, connected via a local-area network (LAN), is used for
accessing an Interchange server.

IMPORTANT NOTE: When sending sensitive information like credit card
numbers over a network, always ensure that the data is secured by a
firewall, or that the Interchange server runs on the same machine as
any SSL-based server used for encryption.

If only running with one method of communication, use the C<->i and
C<->u flags.

   # Start only in UNIX mode
   VENDROOT/bin/interchange -r -u

   # Start only in INET mode
   VENDROOT/bin/interchange -r -i

=head2 User Reconfiguration

The individual catalogs can be reconfigured by the user by running the
[reconfig] support tag. This should be protected by one of the several
forms of Interchange authentication, preferably by HTTP basic
authorization. See C<RemoteUser>.

The command line can be reconfigured (as the Interchange user) with:

   VENDROOT/bin/interchange -reconfig <catalog>

It is easy for the administrator to manually reconfigure a catalog.
Interchange simply looks for a file C<etc/reconfig> (based in the
Interchange software directory) at HouseKeeping time. If it finds a
script name that matches one of the catalogs, it will reconfigure that
catalog.

=head2 Making the Product Database

The DBM product databases can be built offline with the C<offline>
command. The directory to be used for output is specified either on
the command line with the C<-d> option, or is taken from the
C<catalog.cfg> directive C<OfflineDir> -- C<offline> in the catalog
directory by default. The directory must exist. The source ASCII files
should be present in that directory, and the DBM files are created
there. Existing files will be overwritten.

   offline -c catalog [-d offline_dir]

Do a C<perldoc VENDROOT/bin/offline> for full documentation.

=head2 Updating Individual Records

If it takes a long time to build a very large DBM database, consider
using the C<bin/update> script to change just one field in a record,
or to add from a corrections list.

The following updates the products database C<price> field for item
19-202 with the new value 25.00:

   update -c catalog -f price 25.00

More than one field can be updated on a single command line.

   update -c catalog -f price -f comment 25.00 "That pitchfork couple"

The following takes input from C<file>, which must be formatted
exactly like the original database, and adds/corrects any records
contained therein.

   update -c catalog -i file

Invoke the command without any arguments for a usage message
describing the options.

=head2 Expiring Sessions

If Interchange is using DBM capability to store the sessions,
periodically expire old sessions to keep the session database file
from growing too large.

   expire -c catalog

There is also an C<expireall> script which reads all catalog entries
in C<interchange.cfg> and runs C<expire> on them. The C<expire> script
accepts a C<-r> option which tells it to recover lost disk space.

On a UNIX server, add a crontab entry such as the following:

   # once a day at 4:40 am
   40 4 * * *    perl /home/interchange/bin/expireall -r

Interchange will wait until the current transaction is finished before
expiring, so this can be done at any time without disabling web
access. Any search paging files for the affected session (kept in
C<ScratchDir>) will be removed as well.

If not running DBM sessions, use a Perl script to delete all files not
modified in the last one or two days. The following will work if given
an argument of a session directory or session files:

   #!perl
   # expire_sessions.pl -- delete files 2 days old or older

   my @files;
   my $dir;
   foreach $dir (@ARGV) {
       # just push files on the list
       if (-f $dir) { push @files, $_; next; }

       next unless -d $dir;

       # get all the file names in the directory
       opendir DIR, $dir or die "opendir $dir: $!\n";
       push @files, ( map { "$dir/$_" } grep(! /^\.\.?$/, readdir DIR) ) ;
   }

   for (@files) {
       unless (-f $_) {
           warn "skipping $_, not a file.\n";
           next;
       }
       next unless -M $_ >= 2;
       unlink $_ or die "unlink $_: $!\n";
   }

It would be run with a command invocation like:

   perl expire_sessions.pl /home/you/catalogs/simple/session

Multiple directory names are acceptable, if there is more than one
catalog.

This script can be adjusted as necessary. Refinements might include
reading the file to "eval" the session reference and expire only
customers who are not members.

=head1 Debugging

No debug output is provided by default. The source files contain
commented-out '::logDebug(SOMETHING)' statements which can be edited
to activate them. Set the value of C<DebugFile> to a file that will be
written to:

   DebugFile /tmp/mvdebug

=head1 Setup for HTTP Servers

Interchange requires a web server that is already installed on a
system. It does have an internal server which can be used for
administration, testing, and maintenance, but this will not be useful
or desireable in a production environment.

As detailed previously, Interchange is always running in the
background as a daemon, or resident program. It monitors either a
UNIX-domain file-based socket or a series of INET-domain sockets. The
small CGI link program, called in the demo C<simple>, is run to
connect to one of those sockets and provide the link to a browser.

B<Note: >Since Apache is the most popular web server, these
instructions will focus on it. If using another type of web server,
some translation of terms may be necessary.

A C<ScriptAlias> or other CGI execution capability is needed to use
the link program. (The default C<ScriptAlias> for many web servers is
C</cgi-bin>.) If C<ExecCGI> is set for all directories, then any
program ending in a particular file suffix (usually C<.cgi>) will be
seen as a CGI program.

Interchange, by convention, names the link program the same name as
the catalog ID, though this is not required. In the distribution demo,
this would yield a program name or SCRIPT_PATH of C</cgi-bin/simple>
or C</simple.cgi>. This SCRIPT_PATH can be used to determine which
Interchange catalog will be used when the link program is accessed.

=head2 UNIX-Domain Sockets

This is a socket which is not reachable from the Internet directly,
but which must come from a request on the server. The link program
C<vlink> is the provided facility for such communication with
Interchange. This is the most secure way to run a catalog, for there
is no way for systems on the Internet to interact with Interchange
except through its link program.

The most important issue with UNIX-domain sockets on Interchange is
the permissions with which the CGI program and the Interchange server
run. To improve security, Interchange normally runs with the socket
file having 0600 permissions (rw-------), which mandates that the CGI
program and the server run as the same user ID. This means that the
C<vlink> program must be SUID to the same user ID as the server
executes under. (Or that CGIWRAP is used on a single catalog system).

With Interchange's multiple catalog capability, the permissions
situation gets a bit tricky. Interchange comes with a program,
C<makecat>, which configures catalogs for a multiple catalog system.
It should properly set up ownership and permissions for multiple users
if run as the superuser.

=head2 INET-Domain Sockets

These are sockets which are reachable from the Internet directly. The
link program C<tlink> is the provided facility for such communication
with Interchange. Other browsers can talk to the socket directly if
mapped to a catalog with the global C<TcpMap> directive. To improve
security, Interchange usually checks that the request comes from one
of a limited number of systems, defined in the global C<TcpHost>
directive. (This check is not made for the internal HTTP server.)

=head2 Internal HTTP Server

If the socket is contacted directly (only for INET-domain sockets),
Interchange will perform the HTTP server function itself, talking
directly to the browser. It can monitor any number of ports and map
them to a particular catalog. By default, it only maps the special
catalog mv_admin, which performs administrative functions. The default
port is 7786 (ASCII for M an V), which is the default compiled into
the distribution tlink program. This port can be changed via the
C<TcpMap> directive.

To prevent catalogs that do not wish access to be made in this way
from being served from the internal server, Interchange has a fixed
SCRIPT_PATH of C</catalogname> (/simple for the distribution demo)
which needs to be placed as an alias in the Catalog directive to
enable access. See C<TcpMap> for more details.

=head2 Setting Up VLINK and TLINK

The C<vlink> and C<tlink> programs, compiled from C<vlink.c> and
C<tlink.c>, are small C programs which contact and interface to a
running Interchange daemon. The VLINK executable is normally made
setuid to the user account which runs Interchange, so that the
UNIX-domain socket file can be set to secure permissions (user
read-write only). It is normally not necessary for the user to do
anything. They will be compiled by the configuration program. If the
Interchange daemon is not running, either of the programs will display
a message indicating that the server is not available. The following
defines in the produced C<config.h> should be set:

=over 4

=item LINK_FILE

Set this to the name of the socket file that will be used for
configuration, usually "/usr/local/lib/interchange/etc/socket" or the
"etc/socket" under the directory chosen for the VendRoot.

=item LINK_HOST

Set this to the IP number of the host which should be contacted. The
default of 127.0.0.1 (the local machine) is probably best for many
installations.

=item LINK_PORT

Set this to the TCP port number that the Interchange server will
monitor. The default is 7786 (the ASCII codes for 'M' and 'V') and
does not normally need to be changed.

=item LINK_TIMEOUT

Set this to the number of seconds C<vlink> or C<tlink> should wait
before announcing that the Interchange server is not running. The
default of 45 is probably a reasonable value.

=back

=head2 Compiling VLINK and TLINK

There is a C<compile_link> program which will assist with this. Do:

   perldoc VENDROOT/bin/compile_link

for its documentation.

=head2 Manually Compiling VLINK and TLINK

Change directories to the C<src> directory, then run the GNU configure
script:

   cd src
   ./configure

There will be some output displayed as the configure script checks the
system. Then, compile the programs:

   perl compile.pl

To compile manually:

   cc vlink.c -o vlink
   cc tlink.c -o tlink

On manual compiles, ensure that the C compiler will be invoked
properly with this little ditty:

   perl -e 'do "syscfg"; system("$CC $LIBS $CFLAGS $DEFS -o tlink tlink.c");'
   perl -e 'do "syscfg"; system("$CC $LIBS $CFLAGS $DEFS -o vlink vlink.c");'

On some systems, the executable can be made smaller with the strip
program, if available. It is not required.

   strip vlink
   strip tlink

If Interchange is to run under a different user account than the
individual configuring the program, make that user the owner of
C<vlink>. Do not make C<vlink> owned by root, because making C<vlink>
SETUID root is an huge and unnecessary security risk. It should also
not normally run as the default Web user (often C<nobody> or
C<http>)).

   chown interchange vlink

Move the C<vlink> executable to the cgi-bin directory:

   mv vlink /the/cgi-bin/directory

Make C<vlink> SETUID:

   chmod u+s /the/cgi-bin/directory/vlink

Most systems unset the SUID bit when moving the file, so change it
after moving.

The SCRIPT_NAME, as produced by the HTTP server, must match the name
of the program. (As usual, let the makecat program do the work.)

=head1 Frequently Asked Questions

=head2 Configuration Problems

Most Interchange configuration and setup problems are due to one of
the following:

=over 4

=item Wrong information given to makecat program.

B<This is by far the most common problem.> To install a working demo,
Interchange needs to know what the C<DocumentRoot> is and how to run
CGI programs. Details of this setup are server- and site-specific,
which may require some research.

Re-run the configuration again, and pay close attention to the prompts
given. There are examples given which apply to most systems.

If the web server is Apache or NCSA, Interchange will try and parse
its C<httpd.conf> file to help you along, but many ISPs don't allow
users to read these and it may fail.

=item Too-low version of Perl.

If you have a Perl earlier than 5.005, Interchange will not work.
Don't even try an earlier version.

=item Perl compiled with USE_THREADS.

Run C<perl -V>. If you see -DUSE_THREADS in the compilation
definition, you might run into problems with Interchange.

=back

=head2 VLINK or TLINK Compile Problems

The latest version of C<vlink.c> and C<tlink.c> have been compiled on
the following systems:

   AIX 4.1
   BSD2.0 (Pentium/x86)
   Debian GNU/Linux
   Digital Unix (OSF/Alpha)
   FreeBSD 2.x, 3.x, 4.x
   IRIX 5.3, IRIX 6.1
   OpenBSD 2.7
   SCO OpenServer 5.x
   Solaris 2.x (Sun compiler and GCC)
   Solaris 7 (Sun compiler and GCC)
   SunOS 4.1.4
   Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7.0

Some problems may occur. In general, ignore warnings about pointers.

Make sure that you have run the configure program in the src
directory. If you use Interchange's makecat program, it will try to
compile an appropriate link at that time, and will substitute tlink.pl
if that doesn't work.

You can compile manually with the proper settings with this series of
commands:

   cd src
   ./configure
   perl -e 'do "syscfg"; system ("$CC $CFLAGS $DEFS $LIBS -o tlink tlink.c")'
   perl -e 'do "syscfg"; system ("$CC $CFLAGS $DEFS $LIBS -o vlink vlink.c")'

There is also a C<compile_link> program which has docmentation
embedded and which will compile an approprate link. If you cannot
compile, try using the C<tlink.pl> script which should work on most
any system.

=head2 You cannot run the Interchange software as C<root>.

If you are setting Interchange up for the entire machine, and not just
as a virtual host user, it is usual to create a special C<interch>
user to run the daemon and the link program. This means the directory
listing for your cgi-bin should be something like:

 -rwsr-xr-x   1 interchange users        6312 Dec 30 11:39 cgi-bin/simple

and for the socket file it should be:

 srw-------   1 interchange users           0 Dec 30 11:41 etc/socket

Once you have set up the software, you can easily install catalogs as
root B<as long as your C<umask> is set to 2 or 22>.

(The following assumes you have made the Interchange software owned
and run by the special user C<interchange> and that each user has a
Interchange catalogs directory C</home/user/catalogs>).

The best way to set permissions on a multi-user system is to make all
files group readable and writable (660 or 664 mode). If you have a
system setup that places each user in their own group, make
C<interchange> a member of each user's group and set ownership and
permissions with:

       find /home/user/catalogs -print | xargs chown user
       find /home/user/catalogs -print | xargs chgrp user
       find /home/user/catalogs -print | xargs chmod g+rw

For best results, set the user's default umask to 2, so that they
will, by default, create files that have the proper permissions. If
you have all users in the same group, the above is not secure. You
should put C<interchange> in a group of which no user is a member
(perhaps interchange would be a good choice) and set all files owned
by the group interchange and all directories to mode 2770:

This will make files default to the proper group when created (on most
UNIX versions, anyway).

       find /home/user/catalogs -print | xargs chown user
       find /home/user/catalogs -print | xargs chgrp interchange
       find /home/user/catalogs -print | xargs chmod g+rw
       find /home/user/catalogs -type d -print | xargs chmod g+s

If you are on a virtual hosting system, the procedure varies. Making
the program setuid should work for most systems. If your setup uses
CGI-WRAP or another setuid scheme, it should still work. However, you
may have to unset the setuid bit with C<chmod u-s cgi-bin/simple> or
the like. If you have a non-standard CGI setup, as some virtual host
systems do, you will need to know something about UNIX and the web or
engage a consultant to properly set up the paths. Usually switching to
TLINK/INET mode is the easiest thing to do, though with Iserver and a
few others it may take more than that.

If you used the C<makecat> program to build the catalog, it should
have warned you if it was not able to make the link program setuid. To
set the program (in the file C<cgi-bin/simple> in this example) to be
setuid, use the command:

   chmod u+s cgi-bin/simple

=head2 Error -- the Interchange server was not running...

This indicates that the link CGI is not communicating with the
Interchange server. B<Important note:> The server should always be
started by the same user ID which owns the suid vlink program. (This
does not apply to TLINK/INET mode.)

The server must be running, first of all. If you didn't start it, you
can do so by going to the Interchange home directory and typing:

   bin/start

You can check to see if your server is running by typing:

   Linux, SunOS, BSD:    ps -ax | grep interchange
   Most other systems:   ps -elf | grep interchange

B<Note: >Solaris and IRIX truncate the string, and don't allow setting
of the $0 parameter. You may have to grep for 'perl' instead.

If the server is not running, it may have failed due to another
process occupying the TCP socket 7786. If using VLINK, try starting
Interchange with C<start -u>, which will not monitor the
internet-domain socket.

If VLINK is not communicating with the server, there are a number of
possible reasons. First, if you are trying to run Interchange on an
ISP, go to the section about ISP problems. It is probably one of
those. If you are running Interchange on a single machine, it is
probably one of:

   1. Permissions problems
   2. Interchange on NFS-mounted file system

Permissions are easy. If you, for some reason, can't run VLINK as an
SUID program (SUID to your user ID, not to root), you will need to
make permissions more permissive. See the Interchange documentation
for how to use the ReadPermission and WritePermission directives to
make the session files and sockets 'group' or 'world' readable and
writable. If you can make your UID, or the one you have chosen to own
Interchange, the same group as your HTTP user, you can make the files
group read-write. If you can't, you will have to set the dreaded
'world' permissions.

If you are running Interchange on an NFS-mounted file system, it
cannot run in server mode because UNIX-domain sockets don't work on
NFS. You will need to change to static mode from server mode, or
better yet, put Interchange on a file system that is directly mounted.

You can use Interchange in INET mode along with the tlink.c program to
allow running across NFS boundaries. If you have not changed the
configured defaults, and still it will not communicate, you should try
setting the LINK_HOST and LINK_PORT directives in tlink.c and
recompiling.

=head2 I get messages like 'Config.pm not found.' What does it mean?

This means your Perl is not properly installed, or that Interchange is
not using the proper Perl binary. On UNIX, try reinstalling
Interchange and using the standard Perl installation sequence:

   /complete/path/to/proper/perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Otherwise, contact your system administrator.

=head2 Your demo has a very large price for the first item, and when I change the quantity the price drops precipitously.

This was an attempt at humor in the older C<simple> demo catalog.
Check out the Quantity Pricing feature of Interchange. Try looking at:

   http://interchange.akopia.com/cgi-bin/simple/quantity?;00-0011

=head2 Can't locate lib.pm in @INC. BEGIN failed--compilation aborted.

Your Perl is not properly installed. Someone has put a Perl up on your
system, then either moved or removed the library directory. Contact
your system administrator and request that Perl be re-installed.

=head2 Can I run Interchange on my Macintosh?

Interchange will not run on a Macintosh running System 7 or other
"Finder" operating system.

After some manual effort to install the proper Perl modules,
Interchange has been run on Mac OS X. Given the degree of effort
involved this is not considered a tested configuration.

Interchange's *files* can be manipulated by any computer. As long as
uploads/downloads of database source, pages, and configuration files
are done in ASCII mode, there is no reason why they can't be edited on
a Mac. And with MySQL or other ODBC databases on your UNIX-based ISP,
you can even directly interface to the database you use with
Interchange provided you have the scarce ODBC middleware needed for
the Mac. But, you must run it on UNIX or another Mac operating system.
Interchange does run on MkLinux, LinuxPPC, and Mac OS X.

=head2 Shopping cart is dropped when using SSL.

This is usually due to the HostnameLookups (Stronghold/Apache
parameter) not matching for the two servers, secure and non-secure. It
can also be caused by the user having different web proxy addresses
for HTTP and HTTPS. If it still does not work, try changing some of
the appropriate configuration parameters in interchange.cfg:

   DomainTail   No
   IpHead       Yes

If you still are having problems, try this combination in catalog.cfg,
the catalog configuration file:

   SessionExpire  10 minutes
   WideOpen       Yes

The above setting will typically make Interchange work when it is
possible to work. Sometimes when you have multiple Interchange servers
sharing the same secure server, you will have problems after accessing
the second one. (The first one issues a session ID cookie, and that
causes problems).

=head2 Segmentation fault or other core dump.

If this happens when you run the Interchange test or server, it is
always Perl that has a problem. Not sometimes, always. A proper Perl
should never have a segmentation violation, period. And it should not
dump core (unless you passed it a C<-u> option somehow).

You will need to either update Perl or report the bug to the proper
personnel. Depending on your situation and technical ability, this may
be your system admin, ISP, or the Perl porters.

=head2 XXXXXX.pm does not match executable version.

This is a Perl which does not have the right Perl library installed.
It usually results from a naive system administrator who thinks they
can bypass the 'make install' for Perl and just copy the Perl binary
or directories.

In any case, it has nothing to do with Interchange when you are
running on UNIX. Interchange does not include any compiled libraries.

=head2 Interchange doesn't work with RedHat 5.0 (glibc).

This is a defective Perl distributed by RedHat. The problem is that
they don't take GLIBC into account. It will pass make test 100
percent, but strftime dumps core on a segfault. You shouldn't run
RedHat 5.0 anyway. It has drastic security problems. Update to a later
version and build a new Perl.

=head1 ISP Problems

Great strides have been made since Interchange's early days. The great
majority of ISPs provide some CGI service, and more and more run
systems that are compatible with Interchange. The new catalog
configurator for Interchange makes setup much easier. A word of
warning: if you chose your ISP mostly on price, you can expect
problems. The low-cost providers typically have heavily-loaded
machines and many domains. The more domains and the more load the
unhappier you will be with Interchange. Interchange works best on a
fast machine with plenty of memory.

A few Internet Service Provider (ISP) systems still have difficulty
with one or the other aspect of running Interchange. A few cannot (or
will not) run Interchange at all. On top of that, many times ISP
personnel are too busy to help, won't help, or don't know enough to
help. Some are secretive about details of the setup of their systems.

All in all, you can have a fair amount of confidence that your ISP can
run Interchange. Or, you can get one who will.

=head2 No shell access allowed on my ISP.

This used to mean that you were totally out of luck. You probably
still are, but it is at least possible to run Interchange on a virtual
server such as HWY.NET. You should be able to use the tlink.pl program
and INET mode to start using Interchange with quite a bit of work. You
will need to hand-edit all of the configuration files, and use
tlink.pl with the appropriate settings. Long term, you should put a
compiled tlink in place.

You will also have to start the Interchange daemon via a CGI program
that you write. Bottom line: don't try this unless most people call
you a wizard. The Interchange web site has pointers to ISPs who
happily host Interchange.

=head2 No C compiler to compile VLINK or SVEND.

Since VLINK needs certain values set in the source before compilation,
a pre-compiled version will not work. It is recommended that you get
the latest version of Interchange and run in INET mode along with the
tlink.pl Perl-based link program. A pre-compiled tlink.c might also
work for you, if you can use the defaults of 'localhost' and port
7786.

=head2 Perl version too low.

Interchange requires Perl 5.005 or higher. Perl 5.6.0 or higher is
strongly recommended.

=head2 We're sorry, the Interchange server is unavailable...

(The following assumes that you were able to start the Interchange
server.)

This could be almost anything, but with a properly configured
Interchange it is almost undoubtedly due to your cgi-bin and/or your
Interchange directory being located on a different filesystem than the
actua machine that is executing the program. VLINK uses UNIX-domain
sockets, which don't work on NFS-mounted filesystems.

Iserver.com and other systems which use chroot HTTP servers require
quite a bit of extra configuration to get going. If you have not been
careful to set permissions properly when running in VLINK/UNIX mode,
the link CGI will not be able to communicate with the Interchange
server. Please read the documentation that covers this in detail.

You can run in INET mode with the C<tlink> link program to prevent
those problems.

=head2 Document contains no data or premature end of script headers (especially on BSDI or FreeBSD).

This usually means that your HTTP server ran out of resources during
the execution of the link program. It couldn't create more sockets, is
unable to create a process, or can't open any more files.

This usually happens in frames catalogs, when Interchange is sending
more than one page simultaneously. And even more especially on FreeBSD
and BSDI, which are often distributed with the kernel parameters
SOMAXCONN and CHILD_MAX set to levels unsuitable for serving the web.

Go to <http://www.deja.com> and try searching for MAXUSERS. This
should give you plenty of pointers on how to set these parameters
properly.

=head2 My provider runs Windows NT or Windows 2000.

Interchange is unlikely to work on Windows in the near future.

=head2 Interchange server only runs for a while, then dies.

Many ISPs don't allow your user ID to run a program unless it is
logged in! The moment a watchdog program notices a daemon running with
a non-logged-in UID, it terminates the program. Or, it terminates
programs that haven't been active for XX minutes. Contact your ISP
about this. They may be able to do something for you.

=head1 Setup Questions

Interchange is quite powerful, but also quite complex. There are many
possibilities opened up with its conditional HTML, but also many
pitfalls. Read the documentation thoroughly, then inspect the C<basic>
and C<simple> demo pages for help. Pay particular attention to:

   browse*.html
   flypage.html
   results.html
   ord/basket.html
   ord/checkout.html

These pages use many of the powerful features of Interchange, and
studying them will be instructive.

=head2 Can I run multiple catalogs on one server?

Yes. Interchange supports multiple independent catalogs. There are
users who run more than 500 catalogs on a single machine. The capacity
is usually a function of how busy the catalogs are and how much memory
and processor speed your system has.

=head2 How do I start Interchange when I reboot?

Use the standard facility on your operating system. For BSD-style
systems, the file is usually called rc.local (in the /etc directory).

On SVR4 systems, it is quite a bit more complex. Look for the
/etc/rc.d directory and see what other programs do. Often the file is
called S99startup or something similar.

B<Important note:> Interchange must not run as root, which is the user
identity that the startup file executes. The technique to start up
depends on the facility of your su(1) command. This should work on
most operating systems:

   su interchange <<EOF
   /your/interchange/dir/bin/restart
   EOF

The B<EOF> must be the only thing on the line (no leading or trailing
whitespace). If your su(1) command has a C<-c> option (as most System
5 UNIXes do), you can just set:

   su -c /your/interchange/dir/bin/restart interchange

Interchange supplies a C<restart> script which tries to do the above
portably. It works on many operating systems.

=head2 How do I set up a mall?

Interchange can share product databases, session files, and any other
databases. It has many features which support mall building. You can
easily build separate and mostly identical catalogs which you link to
via HTML. But building a mall is as much an exercise in data and
process as in software. Consider the following questions:

=over 4

=item 1.

Who will be clearing payment?

=item 2.

What happens if everyone doesn't have the same tax rate?

=item 3.

How will you clear orders to multiple vendors?

=item 4.

How will you bring together multiple types of shipping?

=item 5.

How will the vendors get product data (including images) to you?

=back

If you cannot answer those questions and visualize how to build a
mall, you probably should not try.

=head2 Can I attach a size or color to a product?

Interchange has product modifiers, or attributes, which can be carried
around with the product. The [item-accessories attribute] tag will
automatically place a suitable select widget on an HTML form, and
"remember" what should be selected. See the Interchange documentation
for Item Attributes.

You can use the SeparateItems directive or set the mv_separate_items
variable on the order form to cause ordered items to be put on
separate lines in the shopping basket. (This is the default in the
demo catalogs.) This makes size/color handling much easier for
multiple items. They can be stacked, which means that you can add
multiple instances of a size or color to an individual product within
a shopping cart entry line, but this is too much trouble.

The attribute information is placed on the form with form fields,
like:

 <INPUT TYPE=XXXXX NAME="[modifier-name size]" VALUE="[item-modifier size]">

The embedded Perl capability of Interchange means that you can
discover the number of items on order of each type, and build quite
detailed input forms.  The Interchange demos have some examples which
should help you. Try ordering the T-Shirt and visiting its flypage.

=head2 PGP encryption -- Server Error

As always, check the error log. The most common problem is something
like:

   akopia.com 3Ex5lvta:akopia.com - [01/Sep/1997:09:08:43] simple /cgi-bin/simple
   > Encryption error:
   >

Probable causes:

=over 4

=item Interchange user ID doesn't have keyring

You must have a C<.pgp> or C<.gnupg> directory in the home directory
of the user running Interchange. It is also possible to set an
environment variable (variously PGPPATH or GNUPGPATH) to orient the
program correctly.

=item Trust problems

If the key you are sending has not been signed by another (trusted)
user, then you will get error returns from some flavors of PGP, which
causes the problem.  Sometimes the fix is to route the error output to
/dev/null by changing the EncryptProgram directive in catalog.cfg:

EncryptProgram  /usr/bin/pgp -fat -r sales@your.com 2>/dev/null

For GNU Privacy Guard, GPG, you would use something like:

EncryptProgram /usr/local/bin/gpg -ea --always-trust -r sales@your.com

=back

=head2 PGP encryption -- What do I do now that it is working?

This depends on what you do with orders once you receive them by
email. Some PC mail agents (notably Eudora) will decrypt the PGP
message embedded within the message text. In that case, you can simply
embed the C<[value mv_credit_card_info]> call right in the message and
be done with it.

If your mailer will not decrypt on the fly, the best way to read the
credit card number is to set up MIME encoding of the order email. To
do this, find the order report you are using. In the standard demos it
is C<pages/ord/report.html> or C<etc/report>.

Set up two MIME regions in that file. First, at the top of the file:

   [tag mime type TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII][/tag]
   [tag mime Order Text]

   ORDER DATE: [calc]localtime[/calc]
   ORDER NUMBER: [value mv_order_number]

   Name: [value name]
   Company: [value company]

   (Rest of order text, including item list)
   [/tag]

Then, at the bottom of the report.html file, put the credit card info:

   [if value mv_credit_card_info]
   [tag mime type application/pgp-encrypted][/tag]
   [tag mime Credit Card Information]

   [value mv_credit_card_info]

   [/tag]
   [/if]

Once this is done, you can read mail using your PGP client as a helper
application to decode the MIME attachment. This does not require a
fancy setup -- you can use the standard MIT PGP 2.6.2 if desired. If
you are using UNIX, set up as the helper for the MIME type
B<application/pgp-encrypted>:

   xterm -e pgp -m %s

More automated or user-friendly setups are left as an exercise for the
user.

=head2 How do I get the number of items in a shopping cart?

If it is simply the total number, extended according to quantity, you
can use the [nitems] tag. If you need this number for use in an
embedded Perl script, you can use:

   $number = $Tag->nitems();

If it is the number of line items you need, then you can use a Perl
script:

   [perl]
       return scalar @{$Carts->{main}};
   [/perl]

(The 'main' refers to the main shopping cart.)

If you have SeparateItems in effect, and need the number of unique
items, you could use:

   [perl]
       my $cart = $Carts->{main};
       foreach my $item (@$cart) {
   @items = split /\|/, $items;
   $count = 0;
   for (@items) {
   $count++ unless $seen{$_}++;
   }
   $count;
   [/perl]

=head2 The demo doesn't do ... (pick one)

That is because it is a demo. It is not intended to be a finished
catalog, just a starting point. Though we like to get reports of
malfunctions in the demo, we feel little urgency about fixing or
responding to such reports.

=head2 Difficulty interacting with browser: Request method for form submission is not POST

There are many possible causes for this error. The main ones are:

=over 4

=item *

This most common case is where the user bookmarks a shopping cart
after Recalc or bookmarks a checkout page. Those pages are usually the
results of form submissions, and are not really a candidate for a
bookmark. You should make sure you provide links to both of those
pages on the interact special page (in special/interact if you have
started with the demo).

=item *

User hits BACK with a very small cache. There are quite a few users
who have decided 10Kbytes is enough of a cache, and that isn't
adequate. (Actually, they probably assumed the number to enter was in
megabytes.)

=item *

One possible cause is that you must define METHOD=POST in all of your
forms, not METHOD=post. The lower case form is not recognized in the
HTTP spec.

=item *

If you are using SSL and don't have a later HTTP server (released
after roughly September 1997), there is a bug in earlier versions
Microsoft Internet Explorer's version of SSL3. Stronghold 2.1.1 works
around this bug. So, if you use Stronghold, you should update.

=back

Interchange also allows you to have forms with METHOD=GET. To use, set
the session ID in your form:

   <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=mv_session_id VALUE="[data session id]">

You might then try METHOD=GET on forms that have problems. This may
prevent errors due to one of the causes above.

=head2 How can I trace the source of a purchase and run a partners program?

Interchange has a facility that adds a parameter called I<source> to
the session database for that user. You should give your partners a
source code, which must contain at least one letter character (A-Za-z
only). It is placed in the sourcing URL as a query string of:

   mv_pc=Source1

If this is appended to the URL with which the user calls Interchange,
it will then be placed in the session identifier C<source>.

This URL:

   <A HREF="http://yourcatalog.com/cgi-in/yourcat/sp_offer?mv_pc=Source1">
       Special offer!&lt;/A>

will yield C<Source1> from the Interchange tag [data session source].

The Interchange 3 idiom C<?;;Source1> continues to be supported, so
existing partner sites should work without change.

=head2 How can I send an email copy of the receipt to a user?

There are several ways, but this is a more complex question than it
may seem like it is. You will have to deal with bad email addresses,
deciding which information to send, showing delivery times, etc. You
also have to be very careful with credit card information. If you have
not taken the proper security measures (by enabling PGP credit card
encryption or using CyberCash), you might just mail them their own
unencrypted credit card number!

This is supported in Interchange via a UserTag, [email ...]. See the
"simple" and "basic" demos.

=head2 Configuring catalog whatever...Use of uninitialized value at Config.pm line 1614, <CONFIG> chunk 322.

This is a warning from Perl indicating that an empty value was found
where one is expected. The warning is left in so that you know that
something is missing. Whatever it is, it can be found at the specified
"chunk," or line, of catalog.cfg. If you use the include capability,
it would have to be factored in as well.

The usual reason is that a file is specified in one of the directives
(usually one of Help, SearchProfile, OrderProfile, Buttonbars, or
UpsZoneFile) and does not exist. See the documentation for the
directive on how the file name should be specified.

=head2 Why isn't the error more enlightening?

Because Perl won't tell us what exactly went wrong. See it's FAQ for
why.

=head2 We need some more information! Problem: unspecified error

This is a fault in the order profile, and can be due to any of the
following:

=over 4

=item *

Problems with encryption.

=item *

Inadvertently setting the same variable twice on the form, causing
problems due to the embedded null.

=item *

Changing the checkout profile and not testing properly under all
conditions.  The order profile must not have non-blank lines that
don't contain valid check procedures (excluding comments). If you are
using a Perl routine in the profile, as above, you must take care that
the routine returns a valid check routine.

=back

=head2 Sorting doesn't work across multiple pages.

If you are using the [sort table:field] idiom, it cannot. It sorts
data present in the list only.

=head2 I am searching for a string and it is not found. I know it is there!

Set C<mv_substring_match> to C<yes> (C<su=yes> in one-clicks). This
most commonly happens when searching for non-ISO-8859 (Cyrillic, or
characters like umlaut and eacute) characters in word-match mode. The
problem is, that unless your locale is set up properly, Perl doesn't
think a non-ISO-8859 and a space character is a boundary.

Also, if you are searching for non-alpha characters, they will also
not be interpreted as word characters and the boundary problems will
still exist.

=head2 How do I display Euro pricing?

You can use Interchange's II8N facilty via the Locale directive. In
catalog.cfg:

 # to define the euro-Settings (PriceDivide is for converting from DM)
Locale eur_EUR PriceDivide         1.95583
Locale eur_EUR p_cs_precedes       0
# this is great - you can even use HTML-Tags to display an euro-image
Locale eur_EUR currency_symbol     "<IMG src="/path/to/image/euro.gif">"
Locale eur_EUR p_sep_by_space      2
Locale eur_EUR mon_decimal_point   ,

# and the DM
Locale de_DE
Locale de_DE p_cs_precedes  0
Locale de_DE p_sep_by_space 2

B<Note: >Be sure to use the latest exchange rates when you establish
your catalog.

On your pages (this is from a search results page, the [item-.... ...]
notation may be different depending on your context):

 [item-price]<br><!-- german is default -->
[setlocale eur_EUR]
  [currency convert=1][item-field price][/currency]<br><!-- the euro -->
[setlocale]

Any questions? Read the docs about "Internationalization."

=head1 Performance Issues

Interchange is not a lightweight program. If you are running it on a
low-end ISP, whose major selling point is low cost, you will
frequently find that Interchange performance is very poor. This is due
to either:

=item Not enough memory

If memory is low, the program will "swap" to disk. If lots of swap is
used, you can expect very bad performance. This is the most common
speed problem.

If your ISP uses IDE hard disks, you can expect REALLY bad
performance. IDE disks are very slow for multi-user machines, which
should have SCSI if ANY swapping is to be done.

=item Too many domains

If there is a huge amount of traffic on the system, then it can run at
a very high "load average." If the machine's load average is routinely
above 2, you can expect problems.

=item Underpowered machine

If it is an old machine, it may be too slow for Interchange. A Pentium
of less than 300MHz is probably not good enough unless it is
completely dedicated to Interchange. The faster the processor, the
happier you will be.

=head2 Interchange runs, but it's sooo sllooowww...

This is almost certainly due to a system that has inadequate memory or
network bandwidth. On a moderately fast ISP server with sufficient
memory, pages should start displaying in less than 2 seconds. On a
fast server, pages should start loading almost instantaneously.

=head2 Interchange slows down over time.

There are many possible reasons for this, but most have to do with
memory or session database size.

=item *

See the documentation on Interchange administration (icadmin) and
learn how to expire your session database. If it is megabytes in size,
accessing a key will significantly slow down the session.

Second, if your machine is memory-poor, you will find that Interchange
gets swapped to disk. Unless your system is very fast, this will
greatly hurt performance. Interchange works best on a machine that
rarely if ever swaps to disk.

Third, this often has nothing to do with Interchange at all but has to
do with your HTTP server. Any long-running daemon has the potential
for a memory leak. Try stopping and starting your HTTP server and
seeing what happens to performance.

=head2 The browse.html page (from the demo) is SLOW!

That is because it is only useful for small product lines. It pulls
out all keys from the entire database and iterates over them, which is
not reasonable for more then 50 products or so (depending on your
server speed). Look at the browse1.html page instead.

A better approach is to use a search and browse by category, an
example of which is given in the demo.

=head2 I am using SQL, and Interchange is so SLOW ...

It isn't Interchange. First of all, did you index your 'SKU' or other
key fields? The reason Interchange doesn't do it for you is that every
SQL database seems to do that a bit differently. Even then, you can
try Interchange's COLUMN_DEF parameter:

Database  products  COLUMN_DEF  code=char(16) PRIMARY KEY

This will at least index the C<code> field for MySQL. Other databases
differ.

Interchange can return VERY fast SQL search results. But you need to
at least give it something to work with. The proper method for fast
selection is:

 [query sql="select code,category,title,price from products" ]

Category: [sql-param category]<BR>
Title:    <A HREF="[area [sql-code]]"> [sql-param title] </A><BR>
Price:    <A HREF="[area order [sql-param 0]]"> [sql-param price] </A><BR>

[/sql]

This is especially powerful when you consider a joined query like:

       SELECT code, price, title, extended.desc
       FROM   products, extended
       WHERE  products.category = 'Renaissance'

Note that the extended.desc field will be accessed as [sql-param
desc]. Don't forget that you must index your fields if you want fast
searching with them as a criteria.

=head2 My session files change to owner root every day!

You have the expireall C<-r> entry in the root crontab, and it should
either be in the Interchange user crontab or run as:

 44 4 * * * su -c "/INTERCHANGE_ROOT/bin/expireall -r" INTERCHANGE_USERNAME

B<When in doubt, restart the server.> It won't take but a few seconds,
and changes in configurable options don't take effect until it is
done. You may even change a page and not see the effect until the
server is restarted.

=head1 Availability and Compatibility

Interchange has been tested on Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and
Digital UNIX/Tru64. Its predecessor, Minivend 3, also reportedly runs
on SCO, AIX, and other Unix ports. It should work on any UNIX-like
operating system with Perl 5.005 or higher and the requisite modules.

=head1 Demo Catalogs

There is a demo catalog included called "foundation". To install the
demo, go to the directory where Interchange is installed and run:

   bin/makecat

Follow the prompts and after restarting the Interchange server, the
demo catalog should be accessable.

=head1 Known Problems

Apache with SUEXEC: VLINK/UNIX socket mode will not work well unless
installed as a normal user. If supporting multiple users, the
TLINK/INET mode must be used.
