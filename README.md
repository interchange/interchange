## Prerequisites

Interchange requires Perl 5.16.3 or later, on a Unix-like operating
system. It is primarily used on various Linux distributions, and has
also been used on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, macOS, and other Unix variants.

Interchange requires some extra Perl modules to be installed on
your system. Unless you are installing from distribution-specific packages
(Red Hat, Debian, etc.) the quick way to install the necessary support is to
run from the untarred Interchange directory:

```
cpanm --installdeps .
```

Alternatively, you can run:

```
perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Interchange'
```

If you would like to use a specific installation of Perl, invoke
Perl with an absolute path to the perl binary, such as

```
/usr/local/bin/perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Interchange'
```

## Installation

You can install Interchange as root for a multi-user system-wide setup, or
as an unprivileged user who will be the only one modifying Interchange files.

Here is the quick installation summary:

```
tar xvzf interchange-5.12.0.tar.gz
cd interchange-5.12.0
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
```

If you would like to use a specific version of Perl, simply invoke
with an absolute path to the perl binary, such as:

```
/usr/local/bin/perl Makefile.PL
```

The build procedure asks where you’d like to install Interchange and
the name of the user account that will own the installation.

The Interchange server doesn’t do much if it isn’t servicing one or more
actual catalogs, so you next need to make your first Interchange catalog,
as described in the next section.

## Demo catalog

There is a demo catalog skeleton called `strap` included.

To build your own catalog from the demo, go to the directory where you
installed Interchange (default is "interchange" in your home directory,
/usr/local/interchange for root installations, or /usr/lib/interchange
for RPM installations) and run:

```
bin/makecat
```

Follow the prompts and after restarting the Interchange server you
should be able to access the new instance of the demo catalog.

Please note that some functionality (notably the reporting features)
may not be available if you are not using an SQL database such as
MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.
